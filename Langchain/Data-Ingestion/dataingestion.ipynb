We are, let me say again, the sincere friends of the German people, and shall desire nothing so much as the early reestablishment of intimate relations of mutual advantage between us—however hard it may be for them, for the time being, to believe that this is spoken from our hearts.\\n\\nWe have borne with their present government through all these bitter months because of that friendship—exercising a patience and forbearance which would otherwise have been impossible. We shall, happily, still have an opportunity to prove that friendship in our daily attitude and actions toward the millions of men and women of German birth and native sympathy who live among us and share our life, and we shall be proud to prove it toward all who are in fact loyal to their neighbors and to the government in the hour of test. They are, most of them, as true and loyal Americans as if they had never known any other fealty or allegiance. They will be prompt to stand with us in rebuking and restraining the few who may be of a different mind and purpose. If there should be disloyalty, it will be dealt with with a firm hand of stern repression; but, if it lifts its head at all, it will lift it only here and there and without countenance except from a lawless and malignant few.\\n\\nIt is a distressing and oppressive duty, gentlemen of the Congress, which I have performed in thus addressing you.

Numerous\\nefforts have since continued to push the boundaries of recurrent language models and encoder-decoder\\narchitectures [38, 24, 15].\\nRecurrent models typically factor computation along the symbol positions of the input and output\\nsequences. Aligning the positions to steps in computation time, they generate a sequence of hidden\\nstates ht, as a function of the previous hidden state ht−1 and the input for position t. This inherently\\nsequential nature precludes parallelization within training examples, which becomes critical at longer\\nsequence lengths, as memory constraints limit batching across examples. Recent work has achieved\\nsignificant improvements in computational efficiency through factorization tricks [21] and conditional\\ncomputation [32], while also improving model performance in case of the latter. The fundamental\\nconstraint of sequential computation, however, remains.\\nAttention mechanisms have become an integral part of compelling sequence modeling and transduc-\\ntion models in various tasks, allowing modeling of dependencies without regard to their distance in\\nthe input or output sequences [2, 19]. In all but a few cases [27], however, such attention mechanisms\\nare used in conjunction with a recurrent network.\\nIn this work we propose the Transformer, a model architecture eschewing recurrence and instead\\nrelying entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output.\\nThe Transformer allows for significantly more parallelization and can reach a new state of the art in\\ntranslation quality after being trained for as little as twelve hours on eight P100 GPUs.\\n2 Background\\nThe goal of reducing sequential computation also forms the foundation of the Extended Neural GPU\\n[16], ByteNet [18] and ConvS2S [9], all of which use convolutional neural networks as basic building\\nblock, computing hidden representations in parallel for all input and output positions. In these models,\\nthe number of operations required to relate signals from two arbitrary input or output positions grows\\nin the distance between positions, linearly for ConvS2S and logarithmically for ByteNet. This makes\\nit more difficult to learn dependencies between distant positions [ 12]. In the Transformer this is\\nreduced to a constant number of operations, albeit at the cost of reduced effective resolution due\\nto averaging attention-weighted positions, an effect we counteract with Multi-Head Attention as\\ndescribed in section 3.2.\\nSelf-attention, sometimes called intra-attention is an attention mechanism relating different positions\\nof a single sequence in order to compute a representation of the sequence. Self-attention has been\\nused successfully in a variety of tasks including reading comprehension, abstractive summarization,\\ntextual entailment and learning task-independent sentence representations [4, 27, 28, 22].\\nEnd-to-end memory networks are based on a recurrent attention mechanism instead of sequence-\\naligned recurrence and have been shown to perform well on simple-language question answering and\\nlanguage modeling tasks [34].\\nTo the best of our knowledge, however, the Transformer is the first transduction model relying\\nentirely on self-attention to compute representations of its input and output without using sequence-\\naligned RNNs or convolution. In the following sections, we will describe the Transformer, motivate\\nself-attention and discuss its advantages over models such as [17, 18] and [9].\\n3 Model Architecture\\nMost competitive neural sequence transduction models have an encoder-decoder structure [5, 2, 35].\\nHere, the encoder maps an input sequence of symbol representations (x1, ..., xn) to a sequence\\nof continuous representations z = (z1, ..., zn). Given z, the decoder then generates an output\\nsequence (y1, ..., ym) of symbols one element at a time. At each step the model is auto-regressive\\n[10], consuming the previously generated symbols as additional input when generating the next.\\n2'),\n",

Each layer has two\\nsub-layers. The first is a multi-head self-attention mechanism, and the second is a simple, position-\\nwise fully connected feed-forward network. We employ a residual connection [11] around each of\\nthe two sub-layers, followed by layer normalization [ 1]. That is, the output of each sub-layer is\\nLayerNorm(x + Sublayer(x)), where Sublayer(x) is the function implemented by the sub-layer\\nitself. To facilitate these residual connections, all sub-layers in the model, as well as the embedding\\nlayers, produce outputs of dimension dmodel = 512.\\nDecoder: The decoder is also composed of a stack of N = 6identical layers. In addition to the two\\nsub-layers in each encoder layer, the decoder inserts a third sub-layer, which performs multi-head\\nattention over the output of the encoder stack. Similar to the encoder, we employ residual connections\\naround each of the sub-layers, followed by layer normalization. We also modify the self-attention\\nsub-layer in the decoder stack to prevent positions from attending to subsequent positions. This\\nmasking, combined with fact that the output embeddings are offset by one position, ensures that the\\npredictions for position i can depend only on the known outputs at positions less than i.\\n3.2 Attention\\nAn attention function can be described as mapping a query and a set of key-value pairs to an output,\\nwhere the query, keys, values, and output are all vectors.

We compute the dot products of the\\nquery with all keys, divide each by √dk, and apply a softmax function to obtain the weights on the\\nvalues.\\nIn practice, we compute the attention function on a set of queries simultaneously, packed together\\ninto a matrix Q. The keys and values are also packed together into matrices K and V . We compute\\nthe matrix of outputs as:\\nAttention(Q, K, V) = softmax(QKT\\n√dk\\n)V (1)\\nThe two most commonly used attention functions are additive attention [2], and dot-product (multi-\\nplicative) attention. Dot-product attention is identical to our algorithm, except for the scaling factor\\nof 1√dk\\n. Additive attention computes the compatibility function using a feed-forward network with\\na single hidden layer. While the two are similar in theoretical complexity, dot-product attention is\\nmuch faster and more space-efficient in practice, since it can be implemented using highly optimized\\nmatrix multiplication code.\\nWhile for small values of dk the two mechanisms perform similarly, additive attention outperforms\\ndot product attention without scaling for larger values of dk [3]. We suspect that for large values of\\ndk, the dot products grow large in magnitude, pushing the softmax function into regions where it has\\nextremely small gradients 4. To counteract this effect, we scale the dot products by 1√dk\\n.\\n3.2.2 Multi-Head Attention\\nInstead of performing a single attention function with dmodel-dimensional keys, values and queries,\\nwe found it beneficial to linearly project the queries, keys and values h times with different, learned\\nlinear projections to dk, dk and dv dimensions, respectively.

For each of these we use\\ndk = dv = dmodel/h = 64. Due to the reduced dimension of each head, the total computational cost\\nis similar to that of single-head attention with full dimensionality.\\n3.2.3 Applications of Attention in our Model\\nThe Transformer uses multi-head attention in three different ways:\\n• In \"encoder-decoder attention\" layers, the queries come from the previous decoder layer,\\nand the memory keys and values come from the output of the encoder. This allows every\\nposition in the decoder to attend over all positions in the input sequence. This mimics the\\ntypical encoder-decoder attention mechanisms in sequence-to-sequence models such as\\n[38, 2, 9].\\n• The encoder contains self-attention layers. In a self-attention layer all of the keys, values\\nand queries come from the same place, in this case, the output of the previous layer in the\\nencoder. Each position in the encoder can attend to all positions in the previous layer of the\\nencoder.\\n• Similarly, self-attention layers in the decoder allow each position in the decoder to attend to\\nall positions in the decoder up to and including that position. We need to prevent leftward\\ninformation flow in the decoder to preserve the auto-regressive property. We implement this\\ninside of scaled dot-product attention by masking out (setting to −∞) all values in the input\\nof the softmax which correspond to illegal connections. See Figure 2.\\n3.3 Position-wise Feed-Forward Networks\\nIn addition to attention sub-layers, each of the layers in our encoder and decoder contains a fully\\nconnected feed-forward network, which is applied to each position separately and identically. This\\nconsists of two linear transformations with a ReLU activation in between.\\nFFN(x) = max(0, xW1 + b1)W2 + b2 (2)\\nWhile the linear transformations are the same across different positions, they use different parameters\\nfrom layer to layer. Another way of describing this is as two convolutions with kernel size 1.\\nThe dimensionality of input and output is dmodel = 512, and the inner-layer has dimensionality\\ndff = 2048.\\n3.4 Embeddings and Softmax\\nSimilarly to other sequence transduction models, we use learned embeddings to convert the input\\ntokens and output tokens to vectors of dimension dmodel. We also use the usual learned linear transfor-\\nmation and softmax function to convert the decoder output to predicted next-token probabilities. In\\nour model, we share the same weight matrix between the two embedding layers and the pre-softmax\\nlinear transformation, similar to [30]. In the embedding layers, we multiply those weights by √dmodel.\\n5'),\n",

To this end, we add \"positional encodings\" to the input embeddings at the\\nbottoms of the encoder and decoder stacks. The positional encodings have the same dimension dmodel\\nas the embeddings, so that the two can be summed. There are many choices of positional encodings,\\nlearned and fixed [9].\\nIn this work, we use sine and cosine functions of different frequencies:\\nP E(pos,2i) = sin(pos/100002i/dmodel )\\nP E(pos,2i+1) = cos(pos/100002i/dmodel )\\nwhere pos is the position and i is the dimension. That is, each dimension of the positional encoding\\ncorresponds to a sinusoid. The wavelengths form a geometric progression from 2π to 10000 · 2π. We\\nchose this function because we hypothesized it would allow the model to easily learn to attend by\\nrelative positions, since for any fixed offset k, P Epos+k can be represented as a linear function of\\nP Epos.\\nWe also experimented with using learned positional embeddings [9] instead, and found that the two\\nversions produced nearly identical results (see Table 3 row (E)). We chose the sinusoidal version\\nbecause it may allow the model to extrapolate to sequence lengths longer than the ones encountered\\nduring training.\\n4 Why Self-Attention\\nIn this section we compare various aspects of self-attention layers to the recurrent and convolu-\\ntional layers commonly used for mapping one variable-length sequence of symbol representations\\n(x1, ..., xn) to another sequence of equal length (z1, ..., zn), with xi, zi ∈ Rd, such as a hidden\\nlayer in a typical sequence transduction encoder or decoder. Motivating our use of self-attention we\\nconsider three desiderata.\\nOne is the total computational complexity per layer. Another is the amount of computation that can\\nbe parallelized, as measured by the minimum number of sequential operations required.\\nThe third is the path length between long-range dependencies in the network. Learning long-range\\ndependencies is a key challenge in many sequence transduction tasks. One key factor affecting the\\nability to learn such dependencies is the length of the paths forward and backward signals have to\\ntraverse in the network. The shorter these paths between any combination of positions in the input\\nand output sequences, the easier it is to learn long-range dependencies [12]. Hence we also compare\\nthe maximum path length between any two input and output positions in networks composed of the\\ndifferent layer types.\\nAs noted in Table 1, a self-attention layer connects all positions with a constant number of sequentially\\nexecuted operations, whereas a recurrent layer requires O(n) sequential operations.

Sentences were encoded using byte-pair encoding [ 3], which has a shared source-\\ntarget vocabulary of about 37000 tokens. For English-French, we used the significantly larger WMT\\n2014 English-French dataset consisting of 36M sentences and split tokens into a 32000 word-piece\\nvocabulary [38]. Sentence pairs were batched together by approximate sequence length. Each training\\nbatch contained a set of sentence pairs containing approximately 25000 source tokens and 25000\\ntarget tokens.\\n5.2 Hardware and Schedule\\nWe trained our models on one machine with 8 NVIDIA P100 GPUs. For our base models using\\nthe hyperparameters described throughout the paper, each training step took about 0.4 seconds. We\\ntrained the base models for a total of 100,000 steps or 12 hours. For our big models,(described on the\\nbottom line of table 3), step time was 1.0 seconds. The big models were trained for 300,000 steps\\n(3.5 days).\\n5.3 Optimizer\\nWe used the Adam optimizer [20] with β1 = 0.9, β2 = 0.98 and ϵ = 10−9.

The configuration of this model is\\nlisted in the bottom line of Table 3. Training took 3.5 days on 8 P100 GPUs. Even our base model\\nsurpasses all previously published models and ensembles, at a fraction of the training cost of any of\\nthe competitive models.\\nOn the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our big model achieves a BLEU score of 41.0,\\noutperforming all of the previously published single models, at less than 1/4 the training cost of the\\nprevious state-of-the-art model. The Transformer (big) model trained for English-to-French used\\ndropout rate Pdrop = 0.1, instead of 0.3.\\nFor the base models, we used a single model obtained by averaging the last 5 checkpoints, which\\nwere written at 10-minute intervals. For the big models, we averaged the last 20 checkpoints. We\\nused beam search with a beam size of 4 and length penalty α = 0.6 [38]. These hyperparameters\\nwere chosen after experimentation on the development set. We set the maximum output length during\\ninference to input length + 50, but terminate early when possible [38].\\nTable 2 summarizes our results and compares our translation quality and training costs to other model\\narchitectures from the literature. We estimate the number of floating point operations used to train a\\nmodel by multiplying the training time, the number of GPUs used, and an estimate of the sustained\\nsingle-precision floating-point capacity of each GPU 5.\\n6.2 Model Variations\\nTo evaluate the importance of different components of the Transformer, we varied our base model\\nin different ways, measuring the change in performance on English-to-German translation on the\\n5We used values of 2.8, 3.7, 6.0 and 9.5 TFLOPS for K80, K40, M40 and P100, respectively.\\n8'),\n",

On both WMT 2014 English-to-German and WMT 2014\\nEnglish-to-French translation tasks, we achieve a new state of the art. In the former task our best\\nmodel outperforms even all previously reported ensembles.\\nWe are excited about the future of attention-based models and plan to apply them to other tasks. We\\nplan to extend the Transformer to problems involving input and output modalities other than text and\\nto investigate local, restricted attention mechanisms to efficiently handle large inputs and outputs\\nsuch as images, audio and video. Making generation less sequential is another research goals of ours.\\nThe code we used to train and evaluate our models is available at https://github.com/\\ntensorflow/tensor2tensor.\\nAcknowledgements We are grateful to Nal Kalchbrenner and Stephan Gouws for their fruitful\\ncomments, corrections and inspiration.\\nReferences\\n[1] Jimmy Lei Ba, Jamie Ryan Kiros, and Geoffrey E Hinton.

It is a field of research in computer science that develops and studies methods and software that enable machines to perceive their environment and use learning and intelligence to take actions that maximize their chances of achieving defined goals.[1]\\nHigh-profile applications of AI include advanced web search engines (e.g., Google Search); recommendation systems (used by YouTube, Amazon, and Netflix); virtual assistants (e.g., Google Assistant, Siri, and Alexa); autonomous vehicles (e.g., Waymo); generative and creative tools (e.g., language models and AI art); and superhuman play and analysis in strategy games (e.g., chess and Go). However, many AI applications are not perceived as AI: \"A lot of cutting edge AI has filtered into general applications, often without being called AI because once something becomes useful enough and common enough it\\'s not labeled AI anymore.\"[2][3]\\nVarious subfields of AI research are centered around particular goals and the use of particular tools. The traditional goals of AI research include learning, reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, natural language processing, perception, and support for robotics.[a] To reach these goals, AI researchers have adapted and integrated a wide range of techniques, including search and mathematical optimization, formal logic, artificial neural networks, and methods based on statistics, operations research, and economics.[b] AI also draws upon psychology, linguistics, philosophy, neuroscience, and other fields.[4] Some companies, such as OpenAI, Google DeepMind and Meta,[5] aim to create artificial general intelligence (AGI) – AI that can complete virtually any cognitive task at least as well as a human.\\nArtificial intelligence was founded as an academic discipline in 1956,[6] and the field went through multiple cycles of optimism throughout its history,[7][8] followed by periods of disappointment and loss of funding, known as AI winters.[9][10] Funding and interest vastly increased after 2012 when graphics processing units started being used to accelerate neural networks, and deep learning outperformed previous AI techniques.[11] This growth accelerated further after 2017 with the transformer architecture.[12] In the 2020s, an ongoing period of rapid progress in advanced generative AI became known as the AI boom. Generative AI\\'s ability to create and modify content has led to several unintended consequences and harms. Ethical concerns have been raised about AI\\'s long-term effects and potential existential risks, prompting discussions about regulatory policies to ensure the safety and benefits of the technology.\\n\\n\\nGoals\\nThe general problem of simulating (or creating) intelligence has been broken into subproblems. These consist of particular traits or capabilities that researchers expect an intelligent system to display. The traits described below have received the most attention and cover the scope of AI research.[a]\\n\\nReasoning and problem-solving\\nEarly researchers developed algorithms that imitated step-by-step reasoning that humans use when they solve puzzles or make logical deductions.[13] By the late 1980s and 1990s, methods were developed for dealing with uncertain or incomplete information, employing concepts from probability and economics.[14]\\nMany of these algorithms are insufficient for solving large reasoning problems because they experience a \"combinatorial explosion\": They become exponentially slower as the problems grow.[15] Even humans rarely use the step-by-step deduction that early AI research could model. They solve most of their problems using fast, intuitive judgments.[16] Accurate and efficient reasoning is an unsolved problem.\\n\\nKnowledge representation\\nAn ontology represents knowledge as a set of concepts within a domain and the relationships between those concepts.\\nKnowledge representation and knowledge engineering[17] allow AI programs to answer questions intelligently and make deductions about real-world facts. Formal knowledge representations are used in content-based indexing and retrieval,[18] scene interpretation,[19] clinical decision support,[20] knowledge discovery (mining \"interesting\" and actionable inferences from large databases),[21] and other areas.[22]\\nA knowledge base is a body of knowledge represented in a form that can be used by a program. An ontology is the set of objects, relations, concepts, and properties used by a particular domain of knowledge.[23] Knowledge bases need to represent things such as objects, properties, categories, and relations between objects;[24] situations, events, states, and time;[25] causes and effects;[26] knowledge about knowledge (what we know about what other people know);[27] default reasoning (things that humans assume are true until they are told differently and will remain true even when other facts are changing);[28] and many other aspects and domains of knowledge.\\nAmong the most difficult problems in knowledge representation are the breadth of commonsense knowledge (the set of atomic facts that the average person knows is enormous);[29] and the sub-symbolic form of most commonsense knowledge (much of what people know is not represented as \"facts\" or \"statements\" that they could express verbally).[16] There is also the difficulty of knowledge acquisition, the problem of obtaining knowledge for AI applications.[c]\\n\\nPlanning and decision-making\\nAn \"agent\" is anything that perceives and takes actions in the world. A rational agent has goals or preferences and takes actions to make them happen.[d][32] In automated planning, the agent has a specific goal.[33] In automated decision-making, the agent has preferences—there are some situations it would prefer to be in, and some situations it is trying to avoid. The decision-making agent assigns a number to each situation (called the \"utility\") that measures how much the agent prefers it. For each possible action, it can calculate the \"expected utility\": the utility of all possible outcomes of the action, weighted by the probability that the outcome will occur. It can then choose the action with the maximum expected utility.[34]\\nIn classical planning, the agent knows exactly what the effect of any action will be.[35] In most real-world problems, however, the agent may not be certain about the situation they are in (it is \"unknown\" or \"unobservable\") and it may not know for certain what will happen after each possible action (it is not \"deterministic\"). It must choose an action by making a probabilistic guess and then reassess the situation to see if the action worked.[36]\\nIn some problems, the agent\\'s preferences may be uncertain, especially if there are other agents or humans involved. These can be learned (e.g., with inverse reinforcement learning), or the agent can seek information to improve its preferences.[37] Information value theory can be used to weigh the value of exploratory or experimental actions.[38] The space of possible future actions and situations is typically intractably large, so the agents must take actions and evaluate situations while being uncertain of what the outcome will be.\\nA Markov decision process has a transition model that describes the probability that a particular action will change the state in a particular way and a reward function that supplies the utility of each state and the cost of each action. A policy associates a decision with each possible state. The policy could be calculated (e.g., by iteration), be heuristic, or it can be learned.[39]\\nGame theory describes the rational behavior of multiple interacting agents and is used in AI programs that make decisions that involve other agents.[40]\\n\\nLearning\\nMachine learning is the study of programs that can improve their performance on a given task automatically.[41] It has been a part of AI from the beginning.[e]\\n\\nIn supervised learning, the training data is labelled with the expected answers, while in unsupervised learning, the model identifies patterns or structures in unlabelled data.\\nThere are several kinds of machine learning. Unsupervised learning analyzes a stream of data and finds patterns and makes predictions without any other guidance.[44] Supervised learning requires labeling the training data with the expected answers, and comes in two main varieties: classification (where the program must learn to predict what category the input belongs in) and regression (where the program must deduce a numeric function based on numeric input).[45]\\nIn reinforcement learning, the agent is rewarded for good responses and punished for bad ones. The agent learns to choose responses that are classified as \"good\".[46] Transfer learning is when the knowledge gained from one problem is applied to a new problem.[47] Deep learning is a type of machine learning that runs inputs through biologically inspired artificial neural networks for all of these types of learning.[48]\\nComputational learning theory can assess learners by computational complexity, by sample complexity (how much data is required), or by other notions of optimization.[49]\\n\\n\\nNatural language processing\\nNatural language processing (NLP) allows programs to read, write and communicate in human languages.[50] Specific problems include speech recognition, speech synthesis, machine translation, information extraction, information retrieval and question answering.[51]\\nEarly work, based on Noam Chomsky\\'s generative grammar and semantic networks, had difficulty with word-sense disambiguation[f] unless restricted to small domains called \"micro-worlds\" (due to the common sense knowledge problem[29]). Margaret Masterman believed that it was meaning and not grammar that was the key to understanding languages, and that thesauri and not dictionaries should be the basis of computational language structure.\\nModern deep learning techniques for NLP include word embedding (representing words, typically as vectors encoding their meaning),[52] transformers (a deep learning architecture using an attention mechanism),[53] and others.[54] In 2019, generative pre-trained transformer (or \"GPT\") language models began to generate coherent text,[55][56] and by 2023, these models were able to get human-level scores on the bar exam, SAT test, GRE test, and many other real-world applications.[57]\\n\\nPerception\\nMachine perception is the ability to use input from sensors (such as cameras, microphones, wireless signals, active lidar, sonar, radar, and tactile sensors) to deduce aspects of the world. Computer vision is the ability to analyze visual input.[58]\\nThe field includes speech recognition,[59] image classification,[60] facial recognition, object recognition,[61] object tracking,[62] and robotic perception.[63]\\n\\nSocial intelligence\\nKismet, a robot head which was made in the 1990s; it is a machine that can recognize and simulate emotions.[64]\\nAffective computing is a field that comprises systems that recognize, interpret, process, or simulate human feeling, emotion, and mood.[65] For example, some virtual assistants are programmed to speak conversationally or even to banter humorously; it makes them appear more sensitive to the emotional dynamics of human interaction, or to otherwise facilitate human–computer interaction.\\nHowever, this tends to give naïve users an unrealistic conception of the intelligence of existing computer agents.[66] Moderate successes related to affective computing include textual sentiment analysis and, more recently, multimodal sentiment analysis, wherein AI classifies the effects displayed by a videotaped subject.[67]\\n\\nGeneral intelligence\\nA machine with artificial general intelligence would be able to solve a wide variety of problems with breadth and versatility similar to human intelligence.[68]\\n\\nTechniques\\nAI research uses a wide variety of techniques to accomplish the goals above.[b]\\n\\nSearch and optimization\\nAI can solve many problems by intelligently searching through many possible solutions.[69] There are two very different kinds of search used in AI: state space search and local search.\\n\\nState space search\\nState space search searches through a tree of possible states to try to find a goal state.[70] For example, planning algorithms search through trees of goals and subgoals, attempting to find a path to a target goal, a process called means-ends analysis.[71]\\nSimple exhaustive searches[72] are rarely sufficient for most real-world problems: the search space (the number of places to search) quickly grows to astronomical numbers. The result is a search that is too slow or never completes.[15] \"Heuristics\" or \"rules of thumb\" can help prioritize choices that are more likely to reach a goal.[73]\\nAdversarial search is used for game-playing programs, such as chess or Go. It searches through a tree of possible moves and countermoves, looking for a winning position.[74]\\n\\nLocal search\\nIllustration of gradient descent for 3 different starting points; two parameters (represented by the plan coordinates) are adjusted in order to minimize the loss function (the height) Local search uses mathematical optimization to find a solution to a problem. It begins with some form of guess and refines it incrementally.[75]\\nGradient descent is a type of local search that optimizes a set of numerical parameters by incrementally adjusting them to minimize a loss function. Variants of gradient descent are commonly used to train neural networks,[76] through the backpropagation algorithm.\\nAnother type of local search is evolutionary computation, which aims to iteratively improve a set of candidate solutions by \"mutating\" and \"recombining\" them, selecting only the fittest to survive each generation.[77]\\nDistributed search processes can coordinate via swarm intelligence algorithms. Two popular swarm algorithms used in search are particle swarm optimization (inspired by bird flocking) and ant colony optimization (inspired by ant trails).[78]\\n\\nLogic\\nFormal logic is used for reasoning and knowledge representation.[79]\\nFormal logic comes in two main forms: propositional logic (which operates on statements that are true or false and uses logical connectives such as \"and\", \"or\", \"not\" and \"implies\")[80] and predicate logic (which also operates on objects, predicates and relations and uses quantifiers such as \"Every X is a Y\" and \"There are some Xs that are Ys\").[81]\\nDeductive reasoning in logic is the process of proving a new statement (conclusion) from other statements that are given and assumed to be true (the premises).[82] Proofs can be structured as proof trees, in which nodes are labelled by sentences, and children nodes are connected to parent nodes by inference rules.\\nGiven a problem and a set of premises, problem-solving reduces to searching for a proof tree whose root node is labelled by a solution of the problem and whose leaf nodes are labelled by premises or axioms. In the case of Horn clauses, problem-solving search can be performed by reasoning forwards from the premises or backwards from the problem.[83] In the more general case of the clausal form of first-order logic, resolution is a single, axiom-free rule of inference, in which a problem is solved by proving a contradiction from premises that include the negation of the problem to be solved.[84]\\nInference in both Horn clause logic and first-order logic is undecidable, and therefore intractable. However, backward reasoning with Horn clauses, which underpins computation in the logic programming language Prolog, is Turing complete. Moreover, its efficiency is competitive with computation in other symbolic programming languages.[85]\\nFuzzy logic assigns a \"degree of truth\" between 0 and 1. It can therefore handle propositions that are vague and partially true.[86]\\nNon-monotonic logics, including logic programming with negation as failure, are designed to handle default reasoning.[28] Other specialized versions of logic have been developed to describe many complex domains.\\n\\nProbabilistic methods for uncertain reasoning\\nA simple Bayesian network, with the associated conditional probability tables\\nMany problems in AI (including reasoning, planning, learning, perception, and robotics) require the agent to operate with incomplete or uncertain information. AI researchers have devised a number of tools to solve these problems using methods from probability theory and economics.[87] Precise mathematical tools have been developed that analyze how an agent can make choices and plan, using decision theory, decision analysis,[88] and information value theory.[89] These tools include models such as Markov decision processes,[90] dynamic decision networks,[91] game theory and mechanism design.[92]\\nBayesian networks[93] are a tool that can be used for reasoning (using the Bayesian inference algorithm),[g][95] learning (using the expectation–maximization algorithm),[h][97] planning (using decision networks)[98] and perception (using dynamic Bayesian networks).[91]\\nProbabilistic algorithms can also be used for filtering, prediction, smoothing, and finding explanations for streams of data, thus helping perception systems analyze processes that occur over time (e.g., hidden Markov models or Kalman filters).[91]\\n\\nExpectation–maximization clustering of Old Faithful eruption data starts from a random guess but then successfully converges on an accurate clustering of the two physically distinct modes of eruption.\\nClassifiers and statistical learning methods\\nThe simplest AI applications can be divided into two types: classifiers (e.g., \"if shiny then diamond\"), on one hand, and controllers (e.g., \"if diamond then pick up\"), on the other hand. Classifiers[99] are functions that use pattern matching to determine the closest match. They can be fine-tuned based on chosen examples using supervised learning. Each pattern (also called an \"observation\") is labeled with a certain predefined class. All the observations combined with their class labels are known as a data set. When a new observation is received, that observation is classified based on previous experience.[45]\\nThere are many kinds of classifiers in use.[100] The decision tree is the simplest and most widely used symbolic machine learning algorithm.[101] K-nearest neighbor algorithm was the most widely used analogical AI until the mid-1990s, and Kernel methods such as the support vector machine (SVM) displaced k-nearest neighbor in the 1990s.[102]\\nThe naive Bayes classifier is reportedly the \"most widely used learner\"[103] at Google, due in part to its scalability.[104]\\nNeural networks are also used as classifiers.[105]\\n\\nArtificial neural networks\\nA neural network is an interconnected group of nodes, akin to the vast network of neurons in the human brain.\\nAn artificial neural network is based on a collection of nodes also known as artificial neurons, which loosely model the neurons in a biological brain. It is trained to recognise patterns; once trained, it can recognise those patterns in fresh data. There is an input, at least one hidden layer of nodes and an output. Each node applies a function and once the weight crosses its specified threshold, the data is transmitted to the next layer. A network is typically called a deep neural network if it has at least 2 hidden layers.[105]\\nLearning algorithms for neural networks use local search to choose the weights that will get the right output for each input during training. The most common training technique is the backpropagation algorithm.[106] Neural networks learn to model complex relationships between inputs and outputs and find patterns in data. In theory, a neural network can learn any function.[107]\\nIn feedforward neural networks the signal passes in only one direction.[108] The term perceptron typically refers to a single-layer neural network.[109] In contrast, deep learning uses many layers.[110] Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) feed the output signal back into the input, which allows short-term memories of previous input events. Long short-term memory networks (LSTMs) are recurrent neural networks that better preserve longterm dependencies and are less sensitive to the vanishing gradient problem.[111] Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) use layers of kernels to more efficiently process local patterns. This local processing is especially important in image processing, where the early CNN layers typically identify simple local patterns such as edges and curves, with subsequent layers detecting more complex patterns like textures, and eventually whole objects.[112]\\n\\nDeep learning\\nDeep learning is a subset of machine learning, which is itself a subset of artificial intelligence.[113]\\nDeep learning uses several layers of neurons between the network\\'s inputs and outputs.[110] The multiple layers can progressively extract higher-level features from the raw input. For example, in image processing, lower layers may identify edges, while higher layers may identify the concepts relevant to a human such as digits, letters, or faces.[114]\\nDeep learning has profoundly improved the performance of programs in many important subfields of artificial intelligence, including computer vision, speech recognition, natural language processing, image classification,[115] and others. The reason that deep learning performs so well in so many applications is not known as of 2021.[116] The sudden success of deep learning in 2012–2015 did not occur because of some new discovery or theoretical breakthrough (deep neural networks and backpropagation had been described by many people, as far back as the 1950s)[i] but because of two factors: the incredible increase in computer power (including the hundred-fold increase in speed by switching to GPUs) and the availability of vast amounts of training data, especially the giant curated datasets used for benchmark testing, such as ImageNet.[j]\\n\\nGPT\\nGenerative pre-trained transformers (GPT) are large language models (LLMs) that generate text based on the semantic relationships between words in sentences. Text-based GPT models are pre-trained on a large corpus of text that can be from the Internet. The pretraining consists of predicting the next token (a token being usually a word, subword, or punctuation). Throughout this pretraining, GPT models accumulate knowledge about the world and can then generate human-like text by repeatedly predicting the next token. Typically, a subsequent training phase makes the model more truthful, useful, and harmless, usually with a technique called reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). Current GPT models are prone to generating falsehoods called \"hallucinations\". These can be reduced with RLHF and quality data, but the problem has been getting worse for reasoning systems.[124] Such systems are used in chatbots, which allow people to ask a question or request a task in simple text.[125][126]\\nCurrent models and services include ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Copilot, and Meta AI.[127] Multimodal GPT models can process different types of data (modalities) such as images, videos, sound, and text.[128]\\n\\nHardware and software\\nMain articles: Programming languages for artificial intelligence and Hardware for artificial intelligence\\nRaspberry Pi AI Kit\\nIn the late 2010s, graphics processing units (GPUs) that were increasingly designed with AI-specific enhancements and used with specialized TensorFlow software had replaced previously used central processing unit (CPUs) as the dominant means for large-scale (commercial and academic) machine learning models\\' training.[129] Specialized programming languages such as Prolog were used in early AI research,[130] but general-purpose programming languages like Python have become predominant.[131]\\nThe transistor density in integrated circuits has been observed to roughly double every 18 months—a trend known as Moore\\'s law, named after the Intel co-founder Gordon Moore, who first identified it. Improvements in GPUs have been even faster,[132] a trend sometimes called Huang\\'s law,[133] named after Nvidia co-founder and CEO Jensen Huang.\\n\\nApplications\\nMain article: Applications of artificial intelligenceAI and machine learning technology is used in most of the essential applications of the 2020s, including:\\nsearch engines (such as Google Search)\\ntargeting online advertisements\\nrecommendation systems (offered by Netflix, YouTube or Amazon) driving internet traffic\\ntargeted advertising (AdSense, Facebook)\\nvirtual assistants (such as Siri or Alexa)\\nautonomous vehicles (including drones, ADAS and self-driving cars)\\nautomatic language translation (Microsoft Translator, Google Translate)\\nfacial recognition (Apple\\'s FaceID or Microsoft\\'s DeepFace and Google\\'s FaceNet)\\nimage labeling (used by Facebook, Apple\\'s Photos and TikTok).\\nThe deployment of AI may be overseen by a chief automation officer (CAO).\\n\\nHealth and medicine\\nMain article: Artificial intelligence in healthcare\\nIt has been suggested that AI can overcome discrepancies in funding allocated to different fields of research.[134]\\nAlphaFold 2 (2021) demonstrated the ability to approximate, in hours rather than months, the 3D structure of a protein.[135] In 2023, it was reported that AI-guided drug discovery helped find a class of antibiotics capable of killing two different types of drug-resistant bacteria.[136] In 2024, researchers used machine learning to accelerate the search for Parkinson\\'s disease drug treatments. Their aim was to identify compounds that block the clumping, or aggregation, of alpha-synuclein (the protein that characterises Parkinson\\'s disease). They were able to speed up the initial screening process ten-fold and reduce the cost by a thousand-fold.[137][138]\\n\\nGames\\nMain article: Artificial intelligence in video games\\nGame playing programs have been used since the 1950s to demonstrate and test AI\\'s most advanced techniques.[139] Deep Blue became the first computer chess-playing system to beat a reigning world chess champion, Garry Kasparov, on 11 May 1997.[140] In 2011, in a Jeopardy! quiz show exhibition match, IBM\\'s question answering system, Watson, defeated the two greatest Jeopardy! champions, Brad Rutter and Ken Jennings, by a significant margin.[141] In March 2016, AlphaGo won 4 out of 5 games of Go in a match with Go champion Lee Sedol, becoming the first computer Go-playing system to beat a professional Go player without handicaps. Then, in 2017, it defeated Ke Jie, who was the best Go player in the world.[142] Other programs handle imperfect-information games, such as the poker-playing program Pluribus.[143] DeepMind developed increasingly generalistic reinforcement learning models, such as with MuZero, which could be trained to play chess, Go, or Atari games.[144] In 2019, DeepMind\\'s AlphaStar achieved grandmaster level in StarCraft II, a particularly challenging real-time strategy game that involves incomplete knowledge of what happens on the map.[145] In 2021, an AI agent competed in a PlayStation Gran Turismo competition, winning against four of the world\\'s best Gran Turismo drivers using deep reinforcement learning.[146] In 2024, Google DeepMind introduced SIMA, a type of AI capable of autonomously playing nine previously unseen open-world video games by observing screen output, as well as executing short, specific tasks in response to natural language instructions.[147]\\n\\nMathematics\\nLarge language models, such as GPT-4, Gemini, Claude, Llama or Mistral, are increasingly used in mathematics. These probabilistic models are versatile, but can also produce wrong answers in the form of hallucinations. They sometimes need a large database of mathematical problems to learn from, but also methods such as supervised fine-tuning[148] or trained classifiers with human-annotated data to improve answers for new problems and learn from corrections.[149] A February 2024 study showed that the performance of some language models for reasoning capabilities in solving math problems not included in their training data was low, even for problems with only minor deviations from trained data.[150] One technique to improve their performance involves training the models to produce correct reasoning steps, rather than just the correct result.[151] The Alibaba Group developed a version of its Qwen models called Qwen2-Math, that achieved state-of-the-art performance on several mathematical benchmarks, including 84% accuracy on the MATH dataset of competition mathematics problems.[152] In January 2025, Microsoft proposed the technique rStar-Math that leverages Monte Carlo tree search and step-by-step reasoning, enabling a relatively small language model like Qwen-7B to solve 53% of the AIME 2024 and 90% of the MATH benchmark problems.[153]\\nAlternatively, dedicated models for mathematical problem solving with higher precision for the outcome including proof of theorems have been developed such as AlphaTensor, AlphaGeometry, AlphaProof and AlphaEvolve[154] all from Google DeepMind,[155] Llemma from EleutherAI[156] or Julius.[157]\\nWhen natural language is used to describe mathematical problems, converters can transform such prompts into a formal language such as Lean to define mathematical tasks. The experimental model Gemini Deep Think accepts natural language prompts directly and achieved gold medal results in the International Math Olympiad of 2025.[158]\\nSome models have been developed to solve challenging problems and reach good results in benchmark tests, others to serve as educational tools in mathematics.[159]\\nTopological deep learning integrates various topological approaches.\\n\\nFinance\\nFinance is one of the fastest growing sectors where applied AI tools are being deployed: from retail online banking to investment advice and insurance, where automated \"robot advisers\" have been in use for some years.[160]\\nAccording to Nicolas Firzli, director of the World Pensions & Investments Forum, it may be too early to see the emergence of highly innovative AI-informed financial products and services. He argues that \"the deployment of AI tools will simply further automatise things: destroying tens of thousands of jobs in banking, financial planning, and pension advice in the process, but I\\'m not sure it will unleash a new wave of [e.g., sophisticated] pension innovation.\"[161]\\n\\nMilitary\\nMain article: Military applications of artificial intelligence\\nVarious countries are deploying AI military applications.[162] The main applications enhance command and control, communications, sensors, integration and interoperability.[163] Research is targeting intelligence collection and analysis, logistics, cyber operations, information operations, and semiautonomous and autonomous vehicles.[162] AI technologies enable coordination of sensors and effectors, threat detection and identification, marking of enemy positions, target acquisition, coordination and deconfliction of distributed Joint Fires between networked combat vehicles, both human-operated and autonomous.[163]\\nAI has been used in military operations in Iraq, Syria, Israel and Ukraine.[162][164][165][166]\\n\\nGenerative AI\\nVincent van Gogh in watercolour created by generative AI softwareThese paragraphs are an excerpt from Generative artificial intelligence.[edit]\\nGenerative artificial intelligence (Generative AI or GenAI) is a subfield of artificial intelligence that uses generative models to generate text, images, videos, audio, software code or other forms of data. These models learn the underlying patterns and structures of their training data and use them to produce new data[167] in response to input, which often comes in the form of natural language prompts.[168][169]\\nThe prevalence of generative AI tools has increased significantly since the AI boom in the 2020s. This boom was made possible by improvements in deep neural networks, particularly large language models (LLMs), which are based on the transformer architecture. Major tools include LLM-based chatbots such as ChatGPT, Claude, Copilot, DeepSeek, Google Gemini and Grok; text-to-image models such as Stable Diffusion, Midjourney, and DALL-E; and text-to-video models such as Veo, LTX and Sora.[170][171][172] Technology companies developing generative AI include Alibaba, Anthropic, Baidu, DeepSeek, Google, Lightricks,[173] Meta AI, Microsoft, Mistral AI, OpenAI, Perplexity AI, xAI,[174] and Yandex.[175]\\nGenerative AI has been adopted in a variety of sectors, including software development, healthcare,[176] finance,[177] entertainment,[178] customer service,[179] sales and marketing,[180] art, writing,[181] and product design.[182]\\n\\n\\nAgents\\nMain article: Agentic AI\\nAI agents are software entities designed to perceive their environment, make decisions, and take actions autonomously to achieve specific goals. These agents can interact with users, their environment, or other agents. AI agents are used in various applications, including virtual assistants, chatbots, autonomous vehicles, game-playing systems, and industrial robotics. AI agents operate within the constraints of their programming, available computational resources, and hardware limitations. This means they are restricted to performing tasks within their defined scope and have finite memory and processing capabilities. In real-world applications, AI agents often face time constraints for decision-making and action execution. Many AI agents incorporate learning algorithms, enabling them to improve their performance over time through experience or training. Using machine learning, AI agents can adapt to new situations and optimise their behaviour for their designated tasks.[183][184][185]\\n\\nWeb search\\nMicrosoft introduced Copilot Search in February 2023 under the name Bing Chat, as a built-in feature for Microsoft Edge and Bing mobile app. Copilot Search provides AI-generated summaries[186] and step-by-step reasoning based of information from web publishers, ranked in Bing Search.[187] \\nFor safety, Copilot uses AI-based classifiers and filters to reduce potentially harmful content.[188]\\nGoogle officially pushed its AI Search at its Google I/O event on 20 May 2025.[189] It keeps people looking at Google instead of clicking on a search result. AI Overviews uses Gemini 2.5 to provide contextual answers to user queries based on web content.[190]\\n\\nSexuality\\nApplications of AI in this domain include AI-enabled menstruation and fertility trackers that analyze user data to offer predictions,[191] AI-integrated sex toys (e.g., teledildonics),[192] AI-generated sexual education content,[193] and AI agents that simulate sexual and romantic partners (e.g., Replika).[194]  AI is also used for the production of non-consensual deepfake pornography, raising significant ethical and legal concerns.[195]\\nAI technologies have also been used to attempt to identify online gender-based violence and online sexual grooming of minors.[196][197]\\n\\nOther industry-specific tasks\\nThere are also thousands of successful AI applications used to solve specific problems for specific industries or institutions. In a 2017 survey, one in five companies reported having incorporated \"AI\" in some offerings or processes.[198] A few examples are energy storage, medical diagnosis, military logistics, applications that predict the result of judicial decisions, foreign policy, or supply chain management.\\nAI applications for evacuation and disaster management are growing. AI has been used to investigate patterns in large-scale and small-scale evacuations using historical data from GPS, videos or social media. Furthermore, AI can provide real-time information on the evacuation conditions.[199][200][201]\\nIn agriculture, AI has helped farmers to increase yield and identify areas that need irrigation, fertilization, pesticide treatments. Agronomists use AI to conduct research and development. AI has been used to predict the ripening time for crops such as tomatoes, monitor soil moisture, operate agricultural robots, conduct predictive analytics, classify livestock pig call emotions, automate greenhouses, detect diseases and pests, and save water.\\nArtificial intelligence is used in astronomy to analyze increasing amounts of available data and applications, mainly for \"classification, regression, clustering, forecasting, generation, discovery, and the development of new scientific insights.\" For example, it is used for discovering exoplanets, forecasting solar activity, and distinguishing between signals and instrumental effects in gravitational wave astronomy. Additionally, it could be used for activities in space, such as space exploration, including the analysis of data from space missions, real-time science decisions of spacecraft, space debris avoidance, and more autonomous operation.\\nDuring the 2024 Indian elections, US$50 million was spent on authorized AI-generated content, notably by creating deepfakes of allied (including sometimes deceased) politicians to better engage with voters, and by translating speeches to various local languages.[202]\\n\\nEthics\\nMain article: Ethics of artificial intelligence\\nStreet art in Tel Aviv[203][204]\\nAI has potential benefits and potential risks.[205] AI may be able to advance science and find solutions for serious problems: Demis Hassabis of DeepMind hopes to \"solve intelligence, and then use that to solve everything else\".[206] However, as the use of AI has become widespread, several unintended consequences and risks have been identified.[207][208] In-production systems can sometimes not factor ethics and bias into their AI training processes, especially when the AI algorithms are inherently unexplainable in deep learning.[209]\\n\\nRisks and harm\\nPrivacy and copyright\\nFurther information: Information privacy and Artificial intelligence and copyright\\nMachine learning algorithms require large amounts of data. The techniques used to acquire this data have raised concerns about privacy, surveillance and copyright.\\nAI-powered devices and services, such as virtual assistants and IoT products, continuously collect personal information, raising concerns about intrusive data gathering and unauthorized access by third parties. The loss of privacy is further exacerbated by AI\\'s ability to process and combine vast amounts of data, potentially leading to a surveillance society where individual activities are constantly monitored and analyzed without adequate safeguards or transparency.\\nSensitive user data collected may include online activity records, geolocation data, video, or audio.[210] For example, in order to build speech recognition algorithms, Amazon has recorded millions of private conversations and allowed temporary workers to listen to and transcribe some of them.[211] Opinions about this widespread surveillance range from those who see it as a necessary evil to those for whom it is clearly unethical and a violation of the right to privacy.[212]\\nAI developers argue that this is the only way to deliver valuable applications and have developed several techniques that attempt to preserve privacy while still obtaining the data, such as data aggregation, de-identification and differential privacy.[213] Since 2016, some privacy experts, such as Cynthia Dwork, have begun to view privacy in terms of fairness. Brian Christian wrote that experts have pivoted \"from the question of \\'what they know\\' to the question of \\'what they\\'re doing with it\\'.\"[214]\\nGenerative AI is often trained on unlicensed copyrighted works, including in domains such as images or computer code; the output is then used under the rationale of \"fair use\". Experts disagree about how well and under what circumstances this rationale will hold up in courts of law; relevant factors may include \"the purpose and character of the use of the copyrighted work\" and \"the effect upon the potential market for the copyrighted work\".[215][216] Website owners can indicate that they do not want their content scraped via a \"robots.txt\" file.[217] However, some companies will scrape content regardless[218][219] because the robots.txt file has no real authority. In 2023, leading authors (including John Grisham and Jonathan Franzen) sued AI companies for using their work to train generative AI.[220][221] Another discussed approach is to envision a separate sui generis system of protection for creations generated by AI to ensure fair attribution and compensation for human authors.[222]\\n\\nDominance by tech giants\\nThe commercial AI scene is dominated by Big Tech companies such as Alphabet Inc., Amazon, Apple Inc., Meta Platforms, and Microsoft.[223][224][225] Some of these players already own the vast majority of existing cloud infrastructure and computing power from data centers, allowing them to entrench further in the marketplace.[226][227]\\n\\nPower needs and environmental impacts\\nSee also: Environmental impacts of artificial intelligence\\nFueled by growth in artificial intelligence, data centers\\' demand for power increased in the 2020s.[228]\\nIn January 2024, the International Energy Agency (IEA) released Electricity 2024, Analysis and Forecast to 2026, forecasting electric power use.[229] This is the first IEA report to make projections for data centers and power consumption for artificial intelligence and cryptocurrency. The report states that power demand for these uses might double by 2026, with additional electric power usage equal to electricity used by the whole Japanese nation.[230]\\nProdigious power consumption by AI is responsible for the growth of fossil fuel use, and might delay closings of obsolete, carbon-emitting coal energy facilities. There is a feverish rise in the construction of data centers throughout the US, making large technology firms (e.g., Microsoft, Meta, Google, Amazon) into voracious consumers of electric power. Projected electric consumption is so immense that there is concern that it will be fulfilled no matter the source. A ChatGPT search involves the use of 10 times the electrical energy as a Google search. The large firms are in haste to find power sources – from nuclear energy to geothermal to fusion. The tech firms argue that – in the long view – AI will be eventually kinder to the environment, but they need the energy now. AI makes the power grid more efficient and \"intelligent\", will assist in the growth of nuclear power, and track overall carbon emissions, according to technology firms.[231]\\nA 2024 Goldman Sachs Research Paper, AI Data Centers and the Coming US Power Demand Surge, found \"US power demand (is) likely to experience growth not seen in a generation....\" and forecasts that, by 2030, US data centers will consume 8% of US power, as opposed to 3% in 2022, presaging growth for the electrical power generation industry by a variety of means.[232] Data centers\\' need for more and more electrical power is such that they might max out the electrical grid. The Big Tech companies counter that AI can be used to maximize the utilization of the grid by all.[233]\\nIn 2024, the Wall Street Journal reported that big AI companies have begun negotiations with the US nuclear power providers to provide electricity to the data centers. In March 2024 Amazon purchased a Pennsylvania nuclear-powered data center for US$650 million.[234] Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said nuclear power is a good option for the data centers.[235]\\nIn September 2024, Microsoft announced an agreement with Constellation Energy to re-open the Three Mile Island nuclear power plant to provide Microsoft with 100% of all electric power produced by the plant for 20 years. Reopening the plant, which suffered a partial nuclear meltdown of its Unit 2 reactor in 1979, will require Constellation to get through strict regulatory processes which will include extensive safety scrutiny from the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission. If approved (this will be the first ever US re-commissioning of a nuclear plant), over 835 megawatts of power – enough for 800,000 homes – of energy will be produced. The cost for re-opening and upgrading is estimated at US$1.6 billion and is dependent on tax breaks for nuclear power contained in the 2022 US Inflation Reduction Act.[236] The US government and the state of Michigan are investing almost US$2 billion to reopen the Palisades Nuclear reactor on Lake Michigan. Closed since 2022, the plant is planned to be reopened in October 2025. The Three Mile Island facility will be renamed the Crane Clean Energy Center after Chris Crane, a nuclear proponent and former CEO of Exelon who was responsible for Exelon\\'s spinoff of Constellation.[237]\\nAfter the last approval in September 2023, Taiwan suspended the approval of data centers north of Taoyuan with a capacity of more than 5 MW in 2024, due to power supply shortages.[238] Taiwan aims to phase out nuclear power by 2025.[238] On the other hand, Singapore imposed a ban on the opening of data centers in 2019 due to electric power, but in 2022, lifted this ban.[238]\\nAlthough most nuclear plants in Japan have been shut down after the 2011 Fukushima nuclear accident, according to an October 2024 Bloomberg article in Japanese, cloud gaming services company Ubitus, in which Nvidia has a stake, is looking for land in Japan near a nuclear power plant for a new data center for generative AI.[239] Ubitus CEO Wesley Kuo said nuclear power plants are the most efficient, cheap and stable power for AI.[239]\\nOn 1 November 2024, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) rejected an application submitted by Talen Energy for approval to supply some electricity from the nuclear power station Susquehanna to Amazon\\'s data center.[240] \\nAccording to the Commission Chairman Willie L. Phillips, it is a burden on the electricity grid as well as a significant cost shifting concern to households and other business sectors.[240]\\nIn 2025, a report prepared by the International Energy Agency estimated the greenhouse gas emissions from the energy consumption of AI at 180 million tons. By 2035, these emissions could rise to 300–500 million tonnes depending on what measures will be taken. This is below 1.5% of the energy sector emissions. The emissions reduction potential of AI was estimated at 5% of the energy sector emissions, but rebound effects (for example if people switch from public transport to autonomous cars) can reduce it.[241]\\n\\nMisinformation\\nSee also: Content moderation\\nYouTube, Facebook and others use recommender systems to guide users to more content. These AI programs were given the goal of maximizing user engagement (that is, the only goal was to keep people watching). The AI learned that users tended to choose misinformation, conspiracy theories, and extreme partisan content, and, to keep them watching, the AI recommended more of it. Users also tended to watch more content on the same subject, so the AI led people into filter bubbles where they received multiple versions of the same misinformation.[242] This convinced many users that the misinformation was true, and ultimately undermined trust in institutions, the media and the government.[243] The AI program had correctly learned to maximize its goal, but the result was harmful to society. After the U.S. election in 2016, major technology companies took some steps to mitigate the problem.[244]\\nIn the early 2020s, generative AI began to create images, audio, and texts that are virtually indistinguishable from real photographs, recordings, or human writing,[245] while realistic AI-generated videos became feasible in the mid-2020s.[246][247][248] It is possible for bad actors to use this technology to create massive amounts of misinformation or propaganda;[249] one such potential malicious use is deepfakes for computational propaganda.[250] AI pioneer Geoffrey Hinton expressed concern about AI enabling \"authoritarian leaders to manipulate their electorates\" on a large scale, among other risks.[251] The ability to influence electorates has been proved in at least one study. This same study shows more inaccurate statements from the models when they advocate for candidates of the political right.[252]\\nAI researchers at Microsoft, OpenAI, universities and other organisations have suggested using \"personhood credentials\" as a way to overcome online deception enabled by AI models.[253]\\n\\nAlgorithmic bias and fairness\\nMain articles: Algorithmic bias and Fairness (machine learning)\\nMachine learning applications can be biased[k] if they learn from biased data.[255] The developers may not be aware that the bias exists.[256] Discriminatory behavior by some LLMs can be observed in their output.[257] Bias can be introduced by the way training data is selected and by the way a model is deployed.[258][255] If a biased algorithm is used to make decisions that can seriously harm people (as it can in medicine, finance, recruitment, housing or policing) then the algorithm may cause discrimination.[259] The field of fairness studies how to prevent harms from algorithmic biases.\\nOn 28 June 2015, Google Photos\\'s new image labeling feature mistakenly identified Jacky Alcine and a friend as \"gorillas\" because they were black. The system was trained on a dataset that contained very few images of black people,[260] a problem called \"sample size disparity\".[261] Google \"fixed\" this problem by preventing the system from labelling anything as a \"gorilla\". Eight years later, in 2023, Google Photos still could not identify a gorilla, and neither could similar products from Apple, Facebook, Microsoft and Amazon.[262]\\nCOMPAS is a commercial program widely used by U.S. courts to assess the likelihood of a defendant becoming a recidivist. In 2016, Julia Angwin at ProPublica discovered that COMPAS exhibited racial bias, despite the fact that the program was not told the races of the defendants. Although the error rate for both whites and blacks was calibrated equal at exactly 61%, the errors for each race were different—the system consistently overestimated the chance that a black person would re-offend and would underestimate the chance that a white person would not re-offend.[263] In 2017, several researchers[l] showed that it was mathematically impossible for COMPAS to accommodate all possible measures of fairness when the base rates of re-offense were different for whites and blacks in the data.[265]\\nA program can make biased decisions even if the data does not explicitly mention a problematic feature (such as \"race\" or \"gender\"). The feature will correlate with other features (like \"address\", \"shopping history\" or \"first name\"), and the program will make the same decisions based on these features as it would on \"race\" or \"gender\".[266] Moritz Hardt said \"the most robust fact in this research area is that fairness through blindness doesn\\'t work.\"[267]\\nCriticism of COMPAS highlighted that machine learning models are designed to make \"predictions\" that are only valid if we assume that the future will resemble the past. If they are trained on data that includes the results of racist decisions in the past, machine learning models must predict that racist decisions will be made in the future. If an application then uses these predictions as recommendations, some of these \"recommendations\" will likely be racist.[268] Thus, machine learning is not well suited to help make decisions in areas where there is hope that the future will be better than the past. It is descriptive rather than prescriptive.[m]\\nBias and unfairness may go undetected because the developers are overwhelmingly white and male: among AI engineers, about 4% are black and 20% are women.[261]\\nThere are various conflicting definitions and mathematical models of fairness. These notions depend on ethical assumptions, and are influenced by beliefs about society. One broad category is distributive fairness, which focuses on the outcomes, often identifying groups and seeking to compensate for statistical disparities. Representational fairness tries to ensure that AI systems do not reinforce negative stereotypes or render certain groups invisible. Procedural fairness focuses on the decision process rather than the outcome. The most relevant notions of fairness may depend on the context, notably the type of AI application and the stakeholders. The subjectivity in the notions of bias and fairness makes it difficult for companies to operationalize them. Having access to sensitive attributes such as race or gender is also considered by many AI ethicists to be necessary in order to compensate for biases, but it may conflict with anti-discrimination laws.[254]\\nAt its 2022 Conference on Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency (ACM FAccT 2022), the Association for Computing Machinery, in Seoul, South Korea, presented and published findings that recommend that until AI and robotics systems are demonstrated to be free of bias mistakes, they are unsafe, and the use of self-learning neural networks trained on vast, unregulated sources of flawed internet data should be curtailed.[dubious – discuss][270]\\n\\nLack of transparency\\nSee also: Explainable AI, Algorithmic transparency, and Right to explanation\\nMany AI systems are so complex that their designers cannot explain how they reach their decisions.[271] Particularly with deep neural networks, in which there are many non-linear relationships between inputs and outputs. But some popular explainability techniques exist.[272]\\nIt is impossible to be certain that a program is operating correctly if no one knows how exactly it works. There have been many cases where a machine learning program passed rigorous tests, but nevertheless learned something different than what the programmers intended. For example, a system that could identify skin diseases better than medical professionals was found to actually have a strong tendency to classify images with a ruler as \"cancerous\", because pictures of malignancies typically include a ruler to show the scale.[273] Another machine learning system designed to help effectively allocate medical resources was found to classify patients with asthma as being at \"low risk\" of dying from pneumonia. Having asthma is actually a severe risk factor, but since the patients having asthma would usually get much more medical care, they were relatively unlikely to die according to the training data. The correlation between asthma and low risk of dying from pneumonia was real, but misleading.[274]\\nPeople who have been harmed by an algorithm\\'s decision have a right to an explanation.[275] Doctors, for example, are expected to clearly and completely explain to their colleagues the reasoning behind any decision they make. Early drafts of the European Union\\'s General Data Protection Regulation in 2016 included an explicit statement that this right exists.[n] Industry experts noted that this is an unsolved problem with no solution in sight. Regulators argued that nevertheless the harm is real: if the problem has no solution, the tools should not be used.[276]\\nDARPA established the XAI (\"Explainable Artificial Intelligence\") program in 2014 to try to solve these problems.[277]\\nSeveral approaches aim to address the transparency problem. SHAP enables to visualise the contribution of each feature to the output.[278] LIME can locally approximate a model\\'s outputs with a simpler, interpretable model.[279] Multitask learning provides a large number of outputs in addition to the target classification. These other outputs can help developers deduce what the network has learned.[280] Deconvolution, DeepDream and other generative methods can allow developers to see what different layers of a deep network for computer vision have learned, and produce output that can suggest what the network is learning.[281] For generative pre-trained transformers, Anthropic developed a technique based on dictionary learning that associates patterns of neuron activations with human-understandable concepts.[282]\\n\\nBad actors and weaponized AI\\nMain articles: Lethal autonomous weapon, Artificial intelligence arms race, and AI safety\\nArtificial intelligence provides a number of tools that are useful to bad actors, such as authoritarian governments, terrorists, criminals or rogue states.\\nA lethal autonomous weapon is a machine that locates, selects and engages human targets without human supervision.[o] Widely available AI tools can be used by bad actors to develop inexpensive autonomous weapons and, if produced at scale, they are potentially weapons of mass destruction.[284] Even when used in conventional warfare, they currently cannot reliably choose targets and could potentially kill an innocent person.[284] In 2014, 30 nations (including China) supported a ban on autonomous weapons under the United Nations\\' Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons, however the United States and others disagreed.[285] By 2015, over fifty countries were reported to be researching battlefield robots.[286]\\nAI tools make it easier for authoritarian governments to efficiently control their citizens in several ways. Face and voice recognition allow widespread surveillance. Machine learning, operating this data, can classify potential enemies of the state and prevent them from hiding. Recommendation systems can precisely target propaganda and misinformation for maximum effect. Deepfakes and generative AI aid in producing misinformation. Advanced AI can make authoritarian centralized decision-making more competitive than liberal and decentralized systems such as markets. It lowers the cost and difficulty of digital warfare and advanced spyware.[287] All these technologies have been available since 2020 or earlier—AI facial recognition systems are already being used for mass surveillance in China.[288][289]\\nThere are many other ways in which AI is expected to help bad actors, some of which can not be foreseen. For example, machine-learning AI is able to design tens of thousands of toxic molecules in a matter of hours.[290]\\n\\nTechnological unemployment\\nMain articles: Workplace impact of artificial intelligence and Technological unemployment\\nEconomists have frequently highlighted the risks of redundancies from AI, and speculated about unemployment if there is no adequate social policy for full employment.[291]\\nIn the past, technology has tended to increase rather than reduce total employment, but economists acknowledge that \"we\\'re in uncharted territory\" with AI.[292] A survey of economists showed disagreement about whether the increasing use of robots and AI will cause a substantial increase in long-term unemployment, but they generally agree that it could be a net benefit if productivity gains are redistributed.[293] Risk estimates vary; for example, in the 2010s, Michael Osborne and Carl Benedikt Frey estimated 47% of U.S. jobs are at \"high risk\" of potential automation, while an OECD report classified only 9% of U.S. jobs as \"high risk\".[p][295] The methodology of speculating about future employment levels has been criticised as lacking evidential foundation, and for implying that technology, rather than social policy, creates unemployment, as opposed to redundancies.[291] In April 2023, it was reported that 70% of the jobs for Chinese video game illustrators had been eliminated by generative artificial intelligence.[296][297]\\nUnlike previous waves of automation, many middle-class jobs may be eliminated by artificial intelligence; The Economist stated in 2015 that \"the worry that AI could do to white-collar jobs what steam power did to blue-collar ones during the Industrial Revolution\" is \"worth taking seriously\".[298] Jobs at extreme risk range from paralegals to fast food cooks, while job demand is likely to increase for care-related professions ranging from personal healthcare to the clergy.[299] In July 2025, Ford CEO Jim Farley predicted that \"artificial intelligence is going to replace literally half of all white-collar workers in the U.S.\"[300]\\nFrom the early days of the development of artificial intelligence, there have been arguments, for example, those put forward by Joseph Weizenbaum, about whether tasks that can be done by computers actually should be done by them, given the difference between computers and humans, and between quantitative calculation and qualitative, value-based judgement.[301]\\n\\nExistential risk\\nMain article: Existential risk from artificial intelligence\\nIt has been argued AI will become so powerful that humanity may irreversibly lose control of it. This could, as physicist Stephen Hawking stated, \"spell the end of the human race\".[302] This scenario has been common in science fiction, when a computer or robot suddenly develops a human-like \"self-awareness\" (or \"sentience\" or \"consciousness\") and becomes a malevolent character.[q] These sci-fi scenarios are misleading in several ways.\\nFirst, AI does not require human-like sentience to be an existential risk. Modern AI programs are given specific goals and use learning and intelligence to achieve them. Philosopher Nick Bostrom argued that if one gives almost any goal to a sufficiently powerful AI, it may choose to destroy humanity to achieve it (he used the example of an automated paperclip factory that destroys the world to get more iron for paperclips).[304] Stuart Russell gives the example of household robot that tries to find a way to kill its owner to prevent it from being unplugged, reasoning that \"you can\\'t fetch the coffee if you\\'re dead.\"[305] In order to be safe for humanity, a superintelligence would have to be genuinely aligned with humanity\\'s morality and values so that it is \"fundamentally on our side\".[306]\\nSecond, Yuval Noah Harari argues that AI does not require a robot body or physical control to pose an existential risk. The essential parts of civilization are not physical. Things like ideologies, law, government, money and the economy are built on language; they exist because there are stories that billions of people believe. The current prevalence of misinformation suggests that an AI could use language to convince people to believe anything, even to take actions that are destructive.[307] Geoffrey Hinton said in 2025 that modern AI is particularly \"good at persuasion\" and getting better all the time. He asks \"Suppose you wanted to invade the capital of the US. Do you have to go there and do it yourself? No. You just have to be good at persuasion.\"[308]\\nThe opinions amongst experts and industry insiders are mixed, with sizable fractions both concerned and unconcerned by risk from eventual superintelligent AI.[309] Personalities such as Stephen Hawking, Bill Gates, and Elon Musk,[310] as well as AI pioneers such as Yoshua Bengio, Stuart Russell, Demis Hassabis, and Sam Altman, have expressed concerns about existential risk from AI.\\nIn May 2023, Geoffrey Hinton announced his resignation from Google in order to be able to \"freely speak out about the risks of AI\" without \"considering how this impacts Google\".[311] He notably mentioned risks of an AI takeover,[312] and stressed that in order to avoid the worst outcomes, establishing safety guidelines will require cooperation among those competing in use of AI.[313]\\nIn 2023, many leading AI experts endorsed the joint statement that \"Mitigating the risk of extinction from AI should be a global priority alongside other societal-scale risks such as pandemics and nuclear war\".[314]\\nSome other researchers were more optimistic. AI pioneer Jürgen Schmidhuber did not sign the joint statement, emphasising that in 95% of all cases, AI research is about making \"human lives longer and healthier and easier.\"[315] While the tools that are now being used to improve lives can also be used by bad actors, \"they can also be used against the bad actors.\"[316][317] Andrew Ng also argued that \"it\\'s a mistake to fall for the doomsday hype on AI—and that regulators who do will only benefit vested interests.\"[318] Yann LeCun \"scoffs at his peers\\' dystopian scenarios of supercharged misinformation and even, eventually, human extinction.\"[319] In the early 2010s, experts argued that the risks are too distant in the future to warrant research or that humans will be valuable from the perspective of a superintelligent machine.[320] However, after 2016, the study of current and future risks and possible solutions became a serious area of research.[321]\\n\\nEthical machines and alignment\\nMain articles: Machine ethics, AI safety, Friendly artificial intelligence, Artificial moral agents, and Human Compatible\\nSee also: Human-AI interaction\\nFriendly AI are machines that have been designed from the beginning to minimize risks and to make choices that benefit humans. Eliezer Yudkowsky, who coined the term, argues that developing friendly AI should be a higher research priority: it may require a large investment and it must be completed before AI becomes an existential risk.[322]\\nMachines with intelligence have the potential to use their intelligence to make ethical decisions. The field of machine ethics provides machines with ethical principles and procedures for resolving ethical dilemmas.[323]\\nThe field of machine ethics is also called computational morality,[323]\\nand was founded at an AAAI symposium in 2005.[324]\\nOther approaches include Wendell Wallach\\'s \"artificial moral agents\"[325] and Stuart J. Russell\\'s three principles for developing provably beneficial machines.[326]\\n\\nOpen source\\nSee also: Open-source artificial intelligence and Lists of open-source artificial intelligence software\\nActive organizations in the AI open-source community include Hugging Face,[327] Google,[328] EleutherAI and Meta.[329] Various AI models, such as Llama 2, Mistral or Stable Diffusion, have been made open-weight,[330][331] meaning that their architecture and trained parameters (the \"weights\") are publicly available. Open-weight models can be freely fine-tuned, which allows companies to specialize them with their own data and for their own use-case.[332] Open-weight models are useful for research and innovation but can also be misused. Since they can be fine-tuned, any built-in security measure, such as objecting to harmful requests, can be trained away until it becomes ineffective. Some researchers warn that future AI models may develop dangerous capabilities (such as the potential to drastically facilitate bioterrorism) and that once released on the Internet, they cannot be deleted everywhere if needed. They recommend pre-release audits and cost-benefit analyses.[333]\\n\\nFrameworks\\nArtificial intelligence projects can be guided by ethical considerations during the design, development, and implementation of an AI system. An AI framework such as the Care and Act Framework, developed by the Alan Turing Institute and based on the SUM values, outlines four main ethical dimensions, defined as follows:[334][335]\\n\\nRespect the dignity of individual people\\nConnect with other people sincerely, openly, and inclusively\\nCare for the wellbeing of everyone\\nProtect social values, justice, and the public interest\\nOther developments in ethical frameworks include those decided upon during the Asilomar Conference, the Montreal Declaration for Responsible AI, and the IEEE\\'s Ethics of Autonomous Systems initiative, among others;[336] however, these principles are not without criticism, especially regarding the people chosen to contribute to these frameworks.[337]\\nPromotion of the wellbeing of the people and communities that these technologies affect requires consideration of the social and ethical implications at all stages of AI system design, development and implementation, and collaboration between job roles such as data scientists, product managers, data engineers, domain experts, and delivery managers.[338]\\nThe UK AI Safety Institute released in 2024 a testing toolset called \\'Inspect\\' for AI safety evaluations available under an MIT open-source licence which is freely available on GitHub and can be improved with third-party packages. It can be used to evaluate AI models in a range of areas including core knowledge, ability to reason, and autonomous capabilities.[339]\\n\\nRegulation\\nMain articles: Regulation of artificial intelligence, Regulation of algorithms, and AI safety\\nThe first global AI Safety Summit was held in the United Kingdom in November 2023 with a declaration calling for international cooperation.\\nThe regulation of artificial intelligence is the development of public sector policies and laws for promoting and regulating AI; it is therefore related to the broader regulation of algorithms.[340] The regulatory and policy landscape for AI is an emerging issue in jurisdictions globally.[341] According to AI Index at Stanford, the annual number of AI-related laws passed in the 127 survey countries jumped from one passed in 2016 to 37 passed in 2022 alone.[342][343] Between 2016 and 2020, more than 30 countries adopted dedicated strategies for AI.[344] Most EU member states had released national AI strategies, as had Canada, China, India, Japan, Mauritius, the Russian Federation, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, U.S., and Vietnam. Others were in the process of elaborating their own AI strategy, including Bangladesh, Malaysia and Tunisia.[344] The Global Partnership on Artificial Intelligence was launched in June 2020, stating a need for AI to be developed in accordance with human rights and democratic values, to ensure public confidence and trust in the technology.[344] Henry Kissinger, Eric Schmidt, and Daniel Huttenlocher published a joint statement in November 2021 calling for a government commission to regulate AI.[345] In 2023, OpenAI leaders published recommendations for the governance of superintelligence, which they believe may happen in less than 10 years.[346] In 2023, the United Nations also launched an advisory body to provide recommendations on AI governance; the body comprises technology company executives, government officials and academics.[347] On 1 August 2024, the EU Artificial Intelligence Act entered into force, establishing the first comprehensive EU-wide AI regulation.[348] In 2024, the Council of Europe created the first international legally binding treaty on AI, called the \"Framework Convention on Artificial Intelligence and Human Rights, Democracy and the Rule of Law\". It was adopted by the European Union, the United States, the United Kingdom, and other signatories.[349]\\nIn a 2022 Ipsos survey, attitudes towards AI varied greatly by country; 78% of Chinese citizens, but only 35% of Americans, agreed that \"products and services using AI have more benefits than drawbacks\".[342] A 2023 Reuters/Ipsos poll found that 61% of Americans agree, and 22% disagree, that AI poses risks to humanity.[350] In a 2023 Fox News poll, 35% of Americans thought it \"very important\", and an additional 41% thought it \"somewhat important\", for the federal government to regulate AI, versus 13% responding \"not very important\" and 8% responding \"not at all important\".[351][352]\\nIn November 2023, the first global AI Safety Summit was held in Bletchley Park in the UK to discuss the near and far term risks of AI and the possibility of mandatory and voluntary regulatory frameworks.[353] 28 countries including the United States, China, and the European Union issued a declaration at the start of the summit, calling for international co-operation to manage the challenges and risks of artificial intelligence.[354][355] In May 2024 at the AI Seoul Summit, 16 global AI tech companies agreed to safety commitments on the development of AI.[356][357]\\n\\nHistory\\nMain article: History of artificial intelligence\\nFor a chronological guide, see Timeline of artificial intelligence.\\nIn 2024, AI patents in China and the US numbered more than three-fourths of AI patents worldwide.[358] Though China had more AI patents, the US had 35% more patents per AI patent-applicant company than China.[358]\\nThe study of mechanical or \"formal\" reasoning began with philosophers and mathematicians in antiquity. The study of logic led directly to Alan Turing\\'s theory of computation, which suggested that a machine, by shuffling symbols as simple as \"0\" and \"1\", could simulate any conceivable form of mathematical reasoning.[359][360] This, along with concurrent discoveries in cybernetics, information theory and neurobiology, led researchers to consider the possibility of building an \"electronic brain\".[r] They developed several areas of research that would become part of AI,[362] such as McCulloch and Pitts design for \"artificial neurons\" in 1943,[117] and Turing\\'s influential 1950 paper \\'Computing Machinery and Intelligence\\', which introduced the Turing test and showed that \"machine intelligence\" was plausible.[363][360]\\nThe field of AI research was founded at a workshop at Dartmouth College in 1956.[s][6] The attendees became the leaders of AI research in the 1960s.[t] They and their students produced programs that the press described as \"astonishing\":[u] computers were learning checkers strategies, solving word problems in algebra, proving logical theorems and speaking English.[v][7] Artificial intelligence laboratories were set up at a number of British and U.S. universities in the latter 1950s and early 1960s.[360]\\nResearchers in the 1960s and the 1970s were convinced that their methods would eventually succeed in creating a machine with general intelligence and considered this the goal of their field.[367] In 1965 Herbert Simon predicted, \"machines will be capable, within twenty years, of doing any work a man can do\".[368] In 1967 Marvin Minsky agreed, writing that \"within a generation\\xa0... the problem of creating \\'artificial intelligence\\' will substantially be solved\".[369] They had, however, underestimated the difficulty of the problem.[w] In 1974, both the U.S. and British governments cut off exploratory research in response to the criticism of Sir James Lighthill[371] and ongoing pressure from the U.S. Congress to fund more productive projects.[372] Minsky and Papert\\'s book Perceptrons was understood as proving that artificial neural networks would never be useful for solving real-world tasks, thus discrediting the approach altogether.[373] The \"AI winter\", a period when obtaining funding for AI projects was difficult, followed.[9]\\nIn the early 1980s, AI research was revived by the commercial success of expert systems,[374] a form of AI program that simulated the knowledge and analytical skills of human experts. By 1985, the market for AI had reached over a billion dollars. At the same time, Japan\\'s fifth generation computer project inspired the U.S. and British governments to restore funding for academic research.[8] However, beginning with the collapse of the Lisp Machine market in 1987, AI once again fell into disrepute, and a second, longer-lasting winter began.[10]\\nUp to this point, most of AI\\'s funding had gone to projects that used high-level symbols to represent mental objects like plans, goals, beliefs, and known facts. In the 1980s, some researchers began to doubt that this approach would be able to imitate all the processes of human cognition, especially perception, robotics, learning and pattern recognition,[375] and began to look into \"sub-symbolic\" approaches.[376] Rodney Brooks rejected \"representation\" in general and focussed directly on engineering machines that move and survive.[x] Judea Pearl, Lotfi Zadeh, and others developed methods that handled incomplete and uncertain information by making reasonable guesses rather than precise logic.[87][381] But the most important development was the revival of \"connectionism\", including neural network research, by Geoffrey Hinton and others.[382] In 1990, Yann LeCun successfully showed that convolutional neural networks can recognize handwritten digits, the first of many successful applications of neural networks.[383]\\nAI gradually restored its reputation in the late 1990s and early 21st century by exploiting formal mathematical methods and by finding specific solutions to specific problems. This \"narrow\" and \"formal\" focus allowed researchers to produce verifiable results and collaborate with other fields (such as statistics, economics and mathematics).[384] By 2000, solutions developed by AI researchers were being widely used, although in the 1990s they were rarely described as \"artificial intelligence\" (a tendency known as the AI effect).[385]\\nHowever, several academic researchers became concerned that AI was no longer pursuing its original goal of creating versatile, fully intelligent machines. Beginning around 2002, they founded the subfield of artificial general intelligence (or \"AGI\"), which had several well-funded institutions by the 2010s.[68]\\nDeep learning began to dominate industry benchmarks in 2012 and was adopted throughout the field.[11]\\nFor many specific tasks, other methods were abandoned.[y]\\nDeep learning\\'s success was based on both hardware improvements (faster computers,[387] graphics processing units, cloud computing[388]) and access to large amounts of data[389] (including curated datasets,[388] such as ImageNet). Deep learning\\'s success led to an enormous increase in interest and funding in AI.[z] The amount of machine learning research (measured by total publications) increased by 50% in the years 2015–2019.[344]\\n\\nThe number of Google searches for the term \"AI\" accelerated in 2022.\\nIn 2016, issues of fairness and the misuse of technology were catapulted into center stage at machine learning conferences, publications vastly increased, funding became available, and many researchers re-focussed their careers on these issues. The alignment problem became a serious field of academic study.[321]\\nIn the late 2010s and early 2020s, AGI companies began to deliver programs that created enormous interest. In 2015, AlphaGo, developed by DeepMind, beat the world champion Go player. The program taught only the game\\'s rules and developed a strategy by itself. GPT-3 is a large language model that was released in 2020 by OpenAI and is capable of generating high-quality human-like text.[390] ChatGPT, launched on 30 November 2022, became the fastest-growing consumer software application in history, gaining over 100 million users in two months.[391] It marked what is widely regarded as AI\\'s breakout year, bringing it into the public consciousness.[392] These programs, and others, inspired an aggressive AI boom, where large companies began investing billions of dollars in AI research. According to AI Impacts, about US$50 billion annually was invested in \"AI\" around 2022 in the U.S. alone and about 20% of the new U.S. Computer Science PhD graduates have specialized in \"AI\".[393] About 800,000 \"AI\"-related U.S. job openings existed in 2022.[394] According to PitchBook research, 22% of newly funded startups in 2024 claimed to be AI companies.[395]\\n\\nPhilosophy\\nMain article: Philosophy of artificial intelligence\\nPhilosophical debates have historically sought to determine the nature of intelligence and how to make intelligent machines.[396] Another major focus has been whether machines can be conscious, and the associated ethical implications.[397] Many other topics in philosophy are relevant to AI, such as epistemology and free will.[398] Rapid advancements have intensified public discussions on the philosophy and ethics of AI.[397]\\n\\nDefining artificial intelligence\\nSee also: Synthetic intelligence, Intelligent agent, Artificial mind, Virtual intelligence, and Dartmouth workshop\\nAlan Turing wrote in 1950 \"I propose to consider the question \\'can machines think\\'?\"[399] He advised changing the question from whether a machine \"thinks\", to \"whether or not it is possible for machinery to show intelligent behaviour\".[399] He devised the Turing test, which measures the ability of a machine to simulate human conversation.[363] Since we can only observe the behavior of the machine, it does not matter if it is \"actually\" thinking or literally has a \"mind\". Turing notes that we can not determine these things about other people but \"it is usual to have a polite convention that everyone thinks.\"[400]\\n\\nThe Turing test can provide some evidence of intelligence, but it penalizes non-human intelligent behavior.[401]\\nRussell and Norvig agree with Turing that intelligence must be defined in terms of external behavior, not internal structure.[1] However, they are critical that the test requires the machine to imitate humans. \"Aeronautical engineering texts\", they wrote, \"do not define the goal of their field as making \\'machines that fly so exactly like pigeons that they can fool other pigeons.\\'\"[402] AI founder John McCarthy agreed, writing that \"Artificial intelligence is not, by definition, simulation of human intelligence\".[403]\\nMcCarthy defines intelligence as \"the computational part of the ability to achieve goals in the world\".[404] Another AI founder, Marvin Minsky, similarly describes it as \"the ability to solve hard problems\".[405] The leading AI textbook defines it as the study of agents that perceive their environment and take actions that maximize their chances of achieving defined goals.[1] These definitions view intelligence in terms of well-defined problems with well-defined solutions, where both the difficulty of the problem and the performance of the program are direct measures of the \"intelligence\" of the machine – and no other philosophical discussion is required, or may not even be possible.\\nAnother definition has been adopted by Google,[406] a major practitioner in the field of AI. This definition stipulates the ability of systems to synthesize information as the manifestation of intelligence, similar to the way it is defined in biological intelligence.\\nAs a result of the many circulating definitions scholars have started to critically analyze and order the AI discourse itself[407] including discussing the many AI narratives and myths to be found within societal, political and academic discourses.[408] Similarly, in practice, some authors have suggested that the term \\'AI\\' is often used too broadly and vaguely. This raises the question of where the line should be drawn between AI and classical algorithms,[409] with many companies during the early 2020s AI boom using the term as a marketing buzzword, often even if they did \"not actually use AI in a material way\".[410]\\nThere has been debate over whether large language models exhibit genuine intelligence or merely simulate it by imitating human text.[411]\\n\\nEvaluating approaches to AI\\nNo established unifying theory or paradigm has guided AI research for most of its history.[aa] The unprecedented success of statistical machine learning in the 2010s eclipsed all other approaches (so much so that some sources, especially in the business world, use the term \"artificial intelligence\" to mean \"machine learning with neural networks\"). This approach is mostly sub-symbolic, soft and narrow. Critics argue that these questions may have to be revisited by future generations of AI researchers.\\n\\nSymbolic AI and its limits\\nSymbolic AI (or \"GOFAI\")[413] simulated the high-level conscious reasoning that people use when they solve puzzles, express legal reasoning and do mathematics. They were highly successful at \"intelligent\" tasks such as algebra or IQ tests. In the 1960s, Newell and Simon proposed the physical symbol systems hypothesis: \"A physical symbol system has the necessary and sufficient means of general intelligent action.\"[414]\\nHowever, the symbolic approach failed on many tasks that humans solve easily, such as learning, recognizing an object or commonsense reasoning. Moravec\\'s paradox is the discovery that high-level \"intelligent\" tasks were easy for AI, but low level \"instinctive\" tasks were extremely difficult.[415] Philosopher Hubert Dreyfus had argued since the 1960s that human expertise depends on unconscious instinct rather than conscious symbol manipulation, and on having a \"feel\" for the situation, rather than explicit symbolic knowledge.[416] Although his arguments had been ridiculed and ignored when they were first presented, eventually, AI research came to agree with him.[ab][16]\\nThe issue is not resolved: sub-symbolic reasoning can make many of the same inscrutable mistakes that human intuition does, such as algorithmic bias. Critics such as Noam Chomsky argue continuing research into symbolic AI will still be necessary to attain general intelligence,[418][419] in part because sub-symbolic AI is a move away from explainable AI: it can be difficult or impossible to understand why a modern statistical AI program made a particular decision. The emerging field of neuro-symbolic artificial intelligence attempts to bridge the two approaches.\\n\\nNeat vs. scruffy\\nMain article: Neats and scruffies\\n\"Neats\" hope that intelligent behavior is described using simple, elegant principles (such as logic, optimization, or neural networks). \"Scruffies\" expect that it necessarily requires solving a large number of unrelated problems. Neats defend their programs with theoretical rigor, scruffies rely mainly on incremental testing to see if they work. This issue was actively discussed in the 1970s and 1980s,[420] but eventually was seen as irrelevant. Modern AI has elements of both.\\n\\nSoft vs. hard computing\\nMain article: Soft computing\\nFinding a provably correct or optimal solution is intractable for many important problems.[15] Soft computing is a set of techniques, including genetic algorithms, fuzzy logic and neural networks, that are tolerant of imprecision, uncertainty, partial truth and approximation. Soft computing was introduced in the late 1980s and most successful AI programs in the 21st century are examples of soft computing with neural networks.\\n\\nNarrow vs. general AI\\nMain articles: Weak artificial intelligence and Artificial general intelligence\\nAI researchers are divided as to whether to pursue the goals of artificial general intelligence and superintelligence directly or to solve as many specific problems as possible (narrow AI) in hopes these solutions will lead indirectly to the field\\'s long-term goals.[421][422] General intelligence is difficult to define and difficult to measure, and modern AI has had more verifiable successes by focusing on specific problems with specific solutions. The sub-field of artificial general intelligence studies this area exclusively.\\n\\nMachine consciousness, sentience, and mind\\nMain articles: Philosophy of artificial intelligence and Artificial consciousness\\nThere is no settled consensus in philosophy of mind on whether a machine can have a mind, consciousness and mental states in the same sense that human beings do. This issue considers the internal experiences of the machine, rather than its external behavior. Mainstream AI research considers this issue irrelevant because it does not affect the goals of the field: to build machines that can solve problems using intelligence. Russell and Norvig add that \"[t]he additional project of making a machine conscious in exactly the way humans are is not one that we are equipped to take on.\"[423] However, the question has become central to the philosophy of mind. It is also typically the central question at issue in artificial intelligence in fiction.\\n\\nConsciousness\\nMain articles: Hard problem of consciousness and Theory of mind\\nDavid Chalmers identified two problems in understanding the mind, which he named the \"hard\" and \"easy\" problems of consciousness.[424] The easy problem is understanding how the brain processes signals, makes plans and controls behavior. The hard problem is explaining how this feels or why it should feel like anything at all, assuming we are right in thinking that it truly does feel like something (Dennett\\'s consciousness illusionism says this is an illusion). While human information processing is easy to explain, human subjective experience is difficult to explain. For example, it is easy to imagine a color-blind person who has learned to identify which objects in their field of view are red, but it is not clear what would be required for the person to know what red looks like.[425]\\n\\nComputationalism and functionalism\\nMain articles: Computational theory of mind and Functionalism (philosophy of mind)\\nComputationalism is the position in the philosophy of mind that the human mind is an information processing system and that thinking is a form of computing. Computationalism argues that the relationship between mind and body is similar or identical to the relationship between software and hardware and thus may be a solution to the mind–body problem. This philosophical position was inspired by the work of AI researchers and cognitive scientists in the 1960s and was originally proposed by philosophers Jerry Fodor and Hilary Putnam.[426]\\nPhilosopher John Searle characterized this position as \"strong AI\": \"The appropriately programmed computer with the right inputs and outputs would thereby have a mind in exactly the same sense human beings have minds.\"[ac] Searle challenges this claim with his Chinese room argument, which attempts to show that even a computer capable of perfectly simulating human behavior would not have a mind.[430]\\n\\nAI welfare and rights\\nIt is difficult or impossible to reliably evaluate whether an advanced AI is sentient (has the ability to feel), and if so, to what degree.[431] But if there is a significant chance that a given machine can feel and suffer, then it may be entitled to certain rights or welfare protection measures, similarly to animals.[432][433] Sapience (a set of capacities related to high intelligence, such as discernment or self-awareness) may provide another moral basis for AI rights.[432] Robot rights are also sometimes proposed as a practical way to integrate autonomous agents into society.[434]\\nIn 2017, the European Union considered granting \"electronic personhood\" to some of the most capable AI systems. Similarly to the legal status of companies, it would have conferred rights but also responsibilities.[435] Critics argued in 2018 that granting rights to AI systems would downplay the importance of human rights, and that legislation should focus on user needs rather than speculative futuristic scenarios. They also noted that robots lacked the autonomy to take part in society on their own.[436][437]\\nProgress in AI increased interest in the topic. Proponents of AI welfare and rights often argue that AI sentience, if it emerges, would be particularly easy to deny. They warn that this may be a moral blind spot analogous to slavery or factory farming, which could lead to large-scale suffering if sentient AI is created and carelessly exploited.[433][432]\\n\\nFuture\\nSuperintelligence and the singularity\\nA superintelligence is a hypothetical agent that would possess intelligence far surpassing that of the brightest and most gifted human mind.[422] If research into artificial general intelligence produced sufficiently intelligent software, it might be able to reprogram and improve itself. The improved software would be even better at improving itself, leading to what I. J. Good called an \"intelligence explosion\" and Vernor Vinge called a \"singularity\".[438]\\nHowever, technologies cannot improve exponentially indefinitely, and typically follow an S-shaped curve, slowing when they reach the physical limits of what the technology can do.[439]\\n\\nTranshumanism\\nMain article: Transhumanism\\nRobot designer Hans Moravec, cyberneticist Kevin Warwick and inventor Ray Kurzweil have predicted that humans and machines may merge in the future into cyborgs that are more capable and powerful than either. This idea, called transhumanism, has roots in the writings of Aldous Huxley and Robert Ettinger.[440]\\nEdward Fredkin argues that \"artificial intelligence is the next step in evolution\", an idea first proposed by Samuel Butler\\'s \"Darwin among the Machines\" as far back as 1863, and expanded upon by George Dyson in his 1998 book Darwin Among the Machines: The Evolution of Global Intelligence.[441]\\n\\nIn fiction\\nMain article: Artificial intelligence in fiction\\nThe word \"robot\" itself was coined by Karel Čapek in his 1921 play R.U.R., the title standing for \"Rossum\\'s Universal Robots\".\\nThought-capable artificial beings have appeared as storytelling devices since antiquity,[442] and have been a persistent theme in science fiction.[443]\\nA common trope in these works began with Mary Shelley\\'s Frankenstein, where a human creation becomes a threat to its masters. This includes such works as Arthur C. Clarke\\'s and Stanley Kubrick\\'s 2001: A Space Odyssey (both 1968), with HAL 9000, the murderous computer in charge of the Discovery One spaceship, as well as The Terminator (1984) and The Matrix (1999). In contrast, the rare loyal robots such as Gort from The Day the Earth Stood Still (1951) and Bishop from Aliens (1986) are less prominent in popular culture.[444]\\nIsaac Asimov introduced the Three Laws of Robotics in many stories, most notably with the \"Multivac\" super-intelligent computer. Asimov\\'s laws are often brought up during lay discussions of machine ethics;[445] while almost all artificial intelligence researchers are familiar with Asimov\\'s laws through popular culture, they generally consider the laws useless for many reasons, one of which is their ambiguity.[446]\\nSeveral works use AI to force us to confront the fundamental question of what makes us human, showing us artificial beings that have the ability to feel, and thus to suffer. This appears in Karel Čapek\\'s R.U.R., the films A.I. Artificial Intelligence and Ex Machina, as well as the novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?, by Philip K. Dick. Dick considers the idea that our understanding of human subjectivity is altered by technology created with artificial intelligence.[447]\\n\\nSee also\\nArtificial consciousness\\xa0– Field in cognitive science\\nArtificial intelligence and elections\\xa0– Impact of AI on political elections\\nArtificial intelligence content detection\\xa0– Software to detect AI-generated content\\nArtificial intelligence in Wikimedia projects – Use of artificial intelligence to develop Wikipedia and other Wikimedia projects\\nAssociation for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI)\\nBehavior selection algorithm\\xa0– Algorithm that selects actions for intelligent agents\\nBusiness process automation\\xa0– Automation of business processes\\nCase-based reasoning\\xa0– Process of solving new problems based on the solutions of similar past problems\\nComputational intelligence\\xa0– Ability of a computer to learn a specific task from data or experimental observation\\nDARWIN EU – A European Union initiative coordinated by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) to generate and utilize real world evidence (RWE) to support the evaluation and supervision of medicines across the EU\\nDigital immortality\\xa0– Hypothetical concept of storing a personality in digital form\\nEmergent algorithm\\xa0– Algorithm exhibiting emergent behavior\\nFemale gendering of AI technologies\\xa0– Gender biases in digital technologyPages displaying short descriptions of redirect targets\\nGlossary of artificial intelligence\\xa0– List of concepts in artificial intelligence\\nIntelligence amplification\\xa0– Use of information technology to augment human intelligence\\nIntelligent agent\\xa0– Software agent which acts autonomously\\nIntelligent automation\\xa0– Software process that combines robotic process automation and artificial intelligence\\nList of artificial intelligence  books\\nList of artificial intelligence journals\\nList of artificial intelligence projects\\nMind uploading\\xa0– Hypothetical process of digitally emulating a brain\\nOrganoid intelligence – Use of brain cells and brain organoids for intelligent computing\\nPseudorandomness\\xa0– Appearing random but actually being generated by a deterministic, causal process\\nRobotic process automation\\xa0– Form of business process automation technology\\nThe Last Day\\xa0– 1967 Welsh science fiction novel\\nWetware computer\\xa0– Computer composed of organic material\\nExplanatory notes\\n\\n\\n^ a b This list of intelligent traits is based on the topics covered by the major AI textbooks, including: Russell & Norvig (2021), Luger & Stubblefield (2004), Poole, Mackworth & Goebel (1998) and Nilsson (1998)\\n\\n^ a b This list of tools is based on the topics covered by the major AI textbooks, including: Russell & Norvig (2021), Luger & Stubblefield (2004), Poole, Mackworth & Goebel (1998) and Nilsson (1998)\\n\\n^ It is among the reasons that expert systems proved to be inefficient for capturing knowledge.[30][31]\\n\\n^ \\n\"Rational agent\" is general term used in economics, philosophy and theoretical artificial intelligence.

But in the context of fairness, it refers to a tendency in favor or against a certain group or individual characteristic, usually in a way that is considered unfair or harmful. A statistically unbiased AI system that produces disparate outcomes for different demographic groups may thus be viewed as biased in the ethical sense.[254]\\n\\n^ Including Jon Kleinberg (Cornell University), Sendhil Mullainathan (University of Chicago), Cynthia Chouldechova (Carnegie Mellon) and Sam Corbett-Davis (Stanford)[264]\\n\\n^ Moritz Hardt (a director at the Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems) argues that machine learning \"is fundamentally the wrong tool for a lot of domains, where you\\'re trying to design interventions and mechanisms that change the world.\"[269]\\n\\n^ When the law was passed in 2018, it still contained a form of this provision.\\n\\n^ This is the United Nations\\' definition, and includes things like land mines as well.[283]\\n\\n^ See table 4; 9% is both the OECD average and the U.S. average.[294]\\n\\n^ Sometimes called a \"robopocalypse\"[303]\\n\\n^ \"Electronic brain\" was the term used by the press around this time.[359][361]\\n\\n^ \\nDaniel Crevier wrote, \"the conference is generally recognized as the official birthdate of the new science.\"[364] Russell and Norvig called the conference \"the inception of artificial intelligence.\"[117]\\n\\n^ \\nRussell and Norvig wrote \"for the next 20 years the field would be dominated by these people and their students.\"[365]\\n\\n^ \\nRussell and Norvig wrote, \"it was astonishing whenever a computer did anything kind of smartish\".[366]\\n\\n^ \\nThe programs described are Arthur Samuel\\'s checkers program for the IBM 701, Daniel Bobrow\\'s STUDENT, Newell and Simon\\'s Logic Theorist and Terry Winograd\\'s SHRDLU.\\n\\n^ Russell and Norvig write: \"in almost all cases, these early systems failed on more difficult problems\"[370]\\n\\n^ \\nEmbodied approaches to AI[377] were championed by Hans Moravec[378] and Rodney Brooks[379] and went by many names: Nouvelle AI.[379] Developmental robotics.[380]\\n\\n^ Matteo Wong wrote in The Atlantic: \"Whereas for decades, computer-science fields such as natural-language processing, computer vision, and robotics used extremely different methods, now they all use a programming method called \"deep learning\".

The theme is “Concepts\\nin Information Theory and Communications”.\\nThe 10th Asia-Europe workshop in “Concepts in Information Theory and Communications” is based on a\\nlongstanding cooperation between Asian and European scientists. The ﬁrst workshop was held in Eindhoven,\\nthe Netherlands in 1989. The idea of the workshop is threefold: 1) to improve the communication between\\nthe scientist in the diﬀerent parts of the world; 2) to exchange knowledge and ideas; and 3) to pay a tribute\\nto a well respected and special scientist.\\nWe are very proud that for this workshop Hirosuke Yamamoto accepted our invitation to be the guest\\nof honour. We also consider Hirosuke Yamamoto as our key lecturer. His style of presenting is extremely\\ninspiring and always very clear. The organizers want to pay special attention to these aspects. Presenters\\nare requested to pay attention to the educational aspects of their presentation and concentrate on the main\\nideas and concepts in the developed theory.\\nA special session “Hardware-Aware Information Theory” will be organized by Brian Kurkoski and Dirk\\nWbben. A special session on Powerline Communications will be organized by Adel Ghazel and Han Vinck.\\nThe mayor of Boppard, Dr. Walter Bersch, opened the AEW10 and welcomed our guests from Japan.\\nBoppard has a long tradition in the cooperation with Japan, especially the city of Ome.\\nA.

However, in several applications, it is assumed that the channels accept only sequences\\nsatisfying some constraints because input sequences violating the constraints cause malfunctions of the channels. The\\nconstraints are called input constraints of the channels.\\nOne of typical examples of input constraints is a (d, k)-constraint which requires that the lengths of runs of 0s should\\nbe at least d and at most k where ‘run’ of 0 means a sub-sequence consisting of consecutive 0s and the sub-sequence\\nis taken so that its length is as long as possible. If d = 0 and k = ∞, then the constraint is called a k-constraint and\\nd-constraint, respectively.\\nThe input constraints which can be represented by ﬁnite directed graphs with labeled edges were well studied [1].\\nMany code construction methods for input constraints were proposed. The state splitting method, proposed by Adler,\\nCoppersmith and Hassner, is one of them and universal in the following sense [2]. If we are given an input constraint\\nrepresented by a ﬁnite directed graph with an injective edge labeling and an R0 < C, then we can construct a ﬁnite\\nstate encoder with a sliding block decoder and code rate at least R0, where C is the capacity of the constraint. If the\\nedge labeling is not injective, then ﬁrst we approximate the constraint with a graph having an injective labeling from\\ninside and apply the ACH coding to the approximation of the constraint [3].\\nSince codes for channels with input constraint are actually used in practical devices, the compactness of the resulting\\ncode and performance indices related to speciﬁc applications should be taken into account in designing the codes.\\nHence, coding techniques speciﬁc to some input constraints were also proposed. These techniques may produce codes\\nwhich are more compact than codes produced by the general techniques. K. Immink proposed many techniques for\\n(d, k)-constraints and a spectral null constraint. These techniques can be found in [4].\\nHere we consider a code construction techniques for the d-constraint given in [4, Section 7.7]. The techniques usually\\ngives small codes. The technique was applied to phase change memory (PCM) by K. Cai in order to construct codes\\nfor a k constraint with very high eﬃciency [5]. The k-constraint for PCM is imposed so that some performance index\\nof the resulting code is optimized. The performance index depends on constrained sequences actually produced by\\nthe resulting code. If we use the Immink coding technique in designing the code, we can easily adjust the code by\\nappropriately choosing code words so that the performance index is optimized.\\nWe interpret the Immink coding technique in terms of the state splitting method and characterize the coding\\ntechnique using follower sets. Then we generalize the coding technique. We also give a constraint to which the coding\\ntechnique can be applied.\\nReferences\\n[1] C.

INTRODUCTION\\nA ﬂash memory is a high-density non-violate memory\\nwhich has been used in data storage devices such as USB\\nmemories or SSDs. Each ﬂash memory consists of cells\\n(ﬂoating gates) which accumulate electric charges for storing\\nmessages. More precisely, a ﬂash memory stores messages\\nby adding electric charges to the cells, and reads messages\\nby quantizing electric charges stored in the cells. It is easy\\nto increase the charge levels of cells since it can be done by\\ninjecting charges per cell. However, it is costly to decrease the\\ncharge levels since it must be done per block (a huge set of\\ncells). Hence, many effective coding schemes which considers\\nthe constraint on overwriting have been studied (e.g., [1], [2]).\\nIt is also important to handle possible errors of ﬂash\\nmemories for accurate message readout. For example, an inter-\\ncell interference (ICI), a shift of charge levels due to the\\ninterference of charges in neighbouring cells, is a typical noise\\nfor ﬂash memories. Since the likelihood of ICI depends on a\\ndata sequence stored in cells, messages should be encoded so\\nthat resulting data sequences do not contain subsequences that\\ncan cause ICI (constraint on sequences) (e.g., [3], [4]).\\nTherefore, for producing reliable ﬂash memories, it is\\ndesired to consider both constraints into consideration. It\\nimplies the necessity of analysis on two-dimensional con-\\nstrained systems, but the analysis is cumbersome, and many\\nproblems have been open up to this moment. We will therefore\\nfocus on Periodic-Finite-Type shifts (PFTs), a class of one-\\ndimensional soﬁc shifts, and discuss how they can be used as a\\nmathematical model of ﬂash memories considering constraints.\\nII. DISCUSSION\\nLet Σ be an alphabet, and denote by Σ∗and ΣZ the sets\\nof ﬁnite sequences (words) and bi-inﬁnite sequences over Σ,\\nrespectively. Deﬁne the shift map σ : ΣZ →ΣZ so that for\\na bi-inﬁnite sequence x = . . . x−1x0x1 . . . over Σ, the i-th\\nsymbol of σ(x) is equal to xi+1. For simplicity, let σr(x) be\\nthe bi-inﬁnite sequence generated by applying σ r times to x.\\nA periodic ﬁnite shift S{F,P } [5], [6] is a set of bi-inﬁnite\\nsequences characterized by period P and an ordered list F =\\n(F0, F1, . . . , FP −1) of ﬁnite forbidden sets Fj ⊂Σ∗, which\\nforbids the appearance of words in a periodic manner. More\\nprecisely, a bi-inﬁnite sequence x = . . . x−1x0x1 . . . is in\\nS{F,P } if and only if there exists an integer r, 0 ≤r ≤P −1,\\nsuch that σr(x) does not contain any word in Fj as a subword\\nstarting at the positions i satisfying i ≡j (mod P). PFTs\\nare also soﬁc shifts; that is, each PFT has its presentation\\n(a labelled directed graph whose bi-inﬁnite labelled paths\\nrepresent bi-inﬁnite sequences in the PFT).\\nConsider a block consisting of n q-level cells, and suppose\\nthat data sequences are overwritten in the block. Let Σ =\\n{0, 1, . . . , q −1} and ℓ(t) = (ℓ(t)\\n1 , ℓ(t)\\n2 , . . . , ℓ(t)\\nn ) ∈Σn be the\\nstored data sequence at the t-th write; that is, the i-th element\\nof ℓ(t) represents the charge level of the i-th cell at the t-th\\nwrite. Set ℓ(0) = (0, 0, . . . , 0) as initialization.\\nFix a prime number P. Deﬁne F(t)\\n=\\n(F(t)\\n0 , F(t)\\n1 ,\\n. . . , F(t)\\nP −1) to be an ordered list of ﬁnite forbidden sets at\\nthe t-th write, where F(0)\\n0\\n= F(0)\\n1\\n= · · · = F(0)\\nP −1 for F(0).\\nGiven ℓ(t) = (ℓ(t)\\n1 , ℓ(t)\\n2 , . . . , ℓ(t)\\nn ), compute a(t)\\nj\\n= max{ℓ(t)\\ni\\n:\\ni ≡j (mod P)} for each 0 ≤j ≤P −1. Then, update\\nF(t+1) = (F(t+1)\\n0\\n, F(t+1)\\n1\\n, . . . , F(t+1)\\nP −1 ) based on F(t) =\\n(F(t)\\n0 , F(t)\\n1 , . . . , F(t)\\nP −1), so that\\nF(t+1)\\nj\\n= F(t)\\nj\\n∪{0, 1, . . . , a(t)\\nj\\n−1}.\\nIf PFT S{F(t+1),P } ̸= ∅, we can ﬁnd a data sequence ℓ(t+1)\\nsatisfying constraints for the (t + 1)-th write.\\nThe coding rate at the t-th write is lower bounded by the ca-\\npacity of S{F(t),P }, which is obtainable from its presentation.\\nHowever, it requires high computational complexity when P\\nis large, or the restriction of data sequences due to F(t)\\nj\\ngets\\ntight when P is very small compared to n. Hence, a suitable\\nvalue on P and relaxed conditions on F(t)\\nj\\nshould be proposed.\\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\\nThis work was supported in part by JSPS KAKENHI Grant-\\nin-Aid for Young Scientists (B), Grant Number 15K15936.\\nREFERENCES\\n[1] A.

This concept provides building blocks for\\ncodes achieving the fundamental limits.\\nOur study on the construction of codes achieving the\\nShannon limits has been continued for over ten years. Tools\\nfor the code construction has been developed one by one and\\npublished in the subsequent papers. This talk reviews and\\nsummarizes our results for the construction of a channel code\\nachieving the fundamental limits. The construction of a lossy\\ncode is presented in [4][5].\\nThe idea of the construction is originated from the applica-\\ntion of the Slepian-Wolf code to channel coding. This idea was\\nﬁrst presented in this workshop [3, Section III], and published\\nin [14, Theorem 4]. Later, we noticed that the similar idea had\\nalready been given by Shannon [15, Fig. 8]. He assumed that\\nan observer has access to both input and output of a channel\\nand send the difference of them to the decoder. In contrast,\\nour idea suggests that such an observer is unnecessary by\\nsharing the common information between the encoder and the\\ndecoder. However, there was no practical construction of both\\nan encoder and a decoder.\\nThe ﬁrst progress is using a two functions (sparse matrices)\\nto construct a code. The effectiveness of this idea was shown\\nin [1][2]. Later, the essence of this idea, which is called hash\\nproperty, was introduced in [6][7], where it is shown that\\nthe idea can be applied to the constructions of multi-terminal\\ncodes [8][9][11]. However, encoding and decoding were still\\nintractable.\\nThe second progress is using a stochastic encoder called\\na constrained-random-number generator introduced in [4][5],\\nwhere the theoretical study comes from [10]. Two approxi-\\nmation algorithms using the sum-product algorithm and the\\nMarkov Chain Monte Carlo method were developed. This\\ntime, we obtained tractable algorithms for encoding but the\\nproof of achievablity to the fundamental limit depends on\\nthe use of the maximum-likelihood decoder, which is still\\nintractable.\\nThe third progress is separating encoding and decoding\\nfunctions. In our above results, we had to ﬁnd a pair of good\\nfunctions (sparse matrices) to achieve the fundamental limit.\\nIt is shown in [12] that for a given arbitrary function we can\\nconstruct a code achieving the fundamental limit.\\nThe last progress is using a constrained-random-number\\ngenerator for the stochastic decoding. The effectiveness of\\nthis idea will be presented in [13]. The result implies that\\nboth an encoder and a decoder can be constructed by using\\nconstrained-random-number generators, where we can use\\ntractable encoding/decoding algorithms by using the sum-\\nproduct algorithm and the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method.\\nREFERENCES\\n[1] S.

The proposed\\ncode C is a linear [n, n −2] code over GF(p) where p ≡1( mod 2d) is a prime or a power of a prime and the code\\nlength parameter n is a certain integer such that n ≤(p −1)/(2d). The proposed code corrects double errors in the\\nerror set Ep,d = {±1, ±αv, . . . , ±α(d−1)v} where α is a primitive element of GF(p) and v = (p −1)/(2d).\\nThe proposed code is suitable for the multidimensional signal constellations. For examples, it can be applied to\\ncorrect at most double nearest neighbor errors on the square signal constellation in case of d = 2 and on the hexagonal\\nsignal constellation in case of d = 3. And specially, in case of d = 1, the proposed code is equivalent to the double error\\ncorrecting code, called negacyclic code proposed by Berlekamp [1] where a decoding algorithm for the negacyclic codes\\nis proposed as well. After four decades, his decoding algorithm has been simpliﬁed by Roth [2], and recently Huber [3]\\nhas made Roth’s algorithm much more accessible to readers in other ﬁelds.\\nThe aim of this presentation is twofold. One is to construct double N-N error-correcting codes for the error set Ep,d\\nmentioned above. The other is to give the corresponding decoding algorithm which corrects more general N-N errors\\nthan {+1, −1} errors. And an example of the decoding process will be shown for d = 3, that is, N-N error correcting\\ncodes on a hexagonal signal constellation.\\nReferences\\n[1] E. Berlekamp, Algebraic Coding Theory.

First, known methods are re-\\nviewed for detecting burst errors and human operation\\nerrors, respectively. Furthermore, we look into their\\nconnections and propose research challenges.\\nI. Introduction\\nWhen information is transmitted over noisy communi-\\ncation systems, it may get scrambled by noise or data may\\nget corrupted. To cope with this, error-detecting codes are\\noften used to help us detect if an error has occurred during\\ntransmission of the message. Note that the system channel\\nmay be a telephone line, a high frequency radio link, or\\na satellite communication link. The noise may be caused\\nby human errors, lightnings, thermal ﬂuctuations, imper-\\nfection in equipment, etc. Due to diﬀerent transmission\\nmedium and noise, errors may exhibit distinct statistical\\ncharacteristics in various application scenarios.\\nTo detect the errors, additional digits (i.e., check digits)\\nare added to the data at the time of transmission. The data\\nalong with the check digits form a codeword. The whole\\nphilosophy of error detection is based on the assumption\\nthat the errors which a code is designed to detect are very\\nfrequent compared with the errors not guarded against by\\nit. Therefore, to design a good error-detecting code, the\\nvery ﬁrst and important task is to have a good understand-\\ning of the statistical behavior of the errors. In this paper,\\nwe will discuss two kinds of errors: 1) burst errors (that\\nare common in many communication channels) and 2)\\nhuman operation errors. Known error-detecting methods\\ndeveloped for both are reviewed, respectively.\\nII. Known error-detecting methods\\nA. Burst errors\\nBurst errors are common transmission errors in many\\ncommunication channels, including magnetic and optical\\nstorage devices. To cope with such errors, a cyclic re-\\ndundancy check (CRC) code [1] (based on polynomial\\ndivision) is very suitable. Due to its easy implementation\\nin binary hardware, numerous varieties of CRCs have been\\nincorporated into technical standards.\\nB. Human operation errors\\nHuman operation errors could be divided into the fol-\\nlowing two classes: 1) Cognitive Errors and 2) Typographic\\nErrors. For more detailed classiﬁcation, one can refer to\\nThis work is supported in part by DFG Grant CH 601/2-1.\\nthe empirical investigations by Beckley [2] and Verhoeﬀ\\n[3].\\nThere is a long list of research articles aiming to de-\\nsign good error-detecting codes against human operation\\nerrors, by using one of the following methods: a) division;\\nb) parity check; c) weighted parity check; d) Luhn formula;\\ne) hybrid system; f) Verhoeﬀ’s method; and g) polynomial.\\nThe underlying ideas include the basic decimal arithmetic\\n(e.g., (a) division), make use of operation over groups [6]\\n(e.g., (b) parity check and (c) weighted parity check meth-\\nods), non-commutative operation over Dihedral groups\\n(e.g.: (f) Verhoeﬀ’s method [3], [4]), and multiplication\\nover ﬁnite ﬁelds (e.g., (g) polynomial method [5]) and\\nvector-matrix multiplications in matrix algebra [7], [8].\\nIII. Open research problems\\nGenerally speaking, a error detecting code can be de-\\nscribed by (n, t, A, G), where n, t are the lengths of the in-\\nformation digits and check digits, respectively; A is the al-\\nphabet (which size can be numerical, alphabetic, alphanu-\\nmeric etc), and G is the operation group/quasigroup. Note\\nthat the well-developed error-control codes work over a\\nﬁnite ﬁeld of a prime power order (and are analyzed for\\nrandom errors). However, the error detection codes desired\\nfor speciﬁed applications may aim for detecting some kinds\\nof atypical errors, and could have an alphabet size beyond\\nthis category. For instance, the best decimal code (with\\n|A| = |G| = 10) is still Verhoeﬀ’s code [3] over the dihedral\\ngroup D5, which was generalized by Gumm in [4] to a code\\nwith alphabet of size 2s, s odd.\\nReferences\\n[1] W.

INTRODUCTION\\nIn the context of channel coding theorems for block codes,\\nrelations among the probability of decoding error, the codeword\\nlength, and the coding rate are discussed. One of famous\\nand classical results in that context is the error exponent,\\nwhich characterizes an exponential error bound converging to\\neither zero or one as the codeword length increases. Consider\\ndiscrete memoryless channels (DMCs). Let random variables\\nX and Y be the input and output of a DMC, respectively. We\\ndenote by PX and WY |X the input and the transition probability\\ndistributions of a DMC, respectively. For a coding rate R\\nbelow capacity and a codeword length N, Gallager [4] gave\\nan exponential upper bound on the probability of maximum\\nlikelihood (ML) error for good codes by deriving the random\\ncoding exponent1\\nEr(R, PX, WY |X) ≔max\\n0≤ρ≤1\\n!\\nE0(ρ, PX, WY |X) −ρR\\n\"\\n,\\n(1)\\nwhere Gallager’s reliability function E0 is deﬁned by\\nE0(ρ, PX, WY |X) ≔−log\\n#\\ny∈Y\\n$ #\\nx∈X\\nPX(x)WY |X(y | x)\\n1\\n1+ρ\\n%1+ρ\\n.\\nIf PX is uniform, we simply write the E0 function as\\nE0(ρ, WY |X). Later, Shannon et al. [12] and Arimoto [2] also\\nderived the sphere packing and the strong converse exponents,\\nrespectively, as functions of the E0 function to give exponential\\nlower bounds on the probability of ML error for arbitrary codes.\\nIn this paper, we investigate extremal q-ary input DMCs\\nachieving the maximum and minimum values of E0(ρ, WY |X)\\nunder a ﬁxed another channel reliability function. Such ex-\\ntremalities were studied by Guill´en i F`abregas et al. [5] and\\nAlsan [1] in binary-input cases, and by the authors in ternary-\\ninput cases. In the paper, we introduce a method for deriving\\nextremalities of arbitrary input DMCs for E0(ρ, WY |X) from\\nsharp bounds on R´enyi’s information measures [10], [11].\\nThis work was partially supported by JSPS KAKENHI, Grant-in-Aid for\\nScientiﬁc Research (C) 26420352 and 17K06422, and Grant-in-Aid for JSPS\\nResearch Fellow 17J11247.\\n1The error exponent Er is usually deﬁned as maxPX Er(R, PX, WY |X),\\nwhere the maximization is taken over all input distributions.\\nII. CONNECTION WITH R´ENYI’S INFORMATION MEASURES\\nIf X follows a uniform distribution, then\\nE0(ρ, WY |X) = Hα(X) −Hα(X | Y)\\n(2)\\nwith α = 1/(1+ρ), where Hα(X) denotes the R´enyi entropy [6]\\nand Hα(X | Y) denotes Arimoto’s conditional R´enyi entropy [2].\\nIn [10], [11], many sharp upper and lower bounds on R´enyi’s\\ninformation measures were derived together with extremal\\nprobability distributions achieving the bounds. Combining\\nthese, we can establish extremalities of arbitrary input DMCs\\nfor E0(ρ, WY |X). As a result, for example, extremal DMCs\\nachieving the maximum and minimum values of the random\\ncoding exponents with a ﬁxed different R´enyi’s information\\nmeasure can be clariﬁed. As summarized in [9, Section II],\\nsome notions of symmetry for DMCs and the method of channel\\nsymmetrization are useful to establish the extremalities for\\nchannel reliability functions under a uniform input distribution.\\nREFERENCES\\n[1] M.

Yao (1979) in the study of parallel computation. It found, since,\\nsurprising applications in many areas of computer science as VLSI layout, switching circuits, and auction theory.\\nA recent hot topic much related to communication complexity is information complexity. The setting can be described\\nas follows.\\nIs it signiﬁcantly easier to compute several instances of a problem simultaneously than sequentially? An aﬃrma-\\ntive answer to this question for communication complexity (the so-called direct-sum conjecture due to Wigderson)\\nwould have deep impact in circuit complexity. Recently, for probabilistic protocols the amortized (= simultaneous)\\ncommunication complexity could be characterized as an information expression.\\nIn the probabilistic setting, a randomized protocol can be regarded as a random variable Π, hence, a probability\\ndistribution on all possible communication protocols. Further, there are deﬁned random variables X and Y on the\\ninputs of the two communicators. The (internal) information complexity I(Π, Y |X) + I(Π, X|Y ) now is the sum of the\\nmutual informations of the protocol with each of the communicators inputs.\\nIt turns out that this information complexity characterizes the amortized communication complexity for probabilistic\\nprotocols. Such a single-letter characterization for some special functions was obtained for deterministic protocols by\\nthe Bielefeld group in the early 1990’s. These results coincide with a general formula in this case conjectured in the\\nsurvey by Braverman et al. in the IEEE Information Theory Society Newsletter.\\n8\\nFeature Selection for Computer-Aided Detection of\\nCancer types\\nPeter H.N. de With, Fons van der Sommen, Patrick Langenhuizen and Joost van der Putten\\nEindhoven University of Technology, PO Box 513, 5600 MB Eindhoven, NL\\nBarrett’s Esophagus (BE) is a condition in which the body replaces the normal lining of the esophagus with an\\nacid-resistant cell type, to prevent tissue damage caused by gastric reﬂux. This is correlated with an unhealthy lifestyle\\nand it is a known precursor of esophageal cancer, yielding an over 30-fold increased chance of this deadly disease.\\nFor further developed cancer stages in brain tumors, cancer detection occurs frequently at later stage, but in such a\\ncase, cancer detection with imaging can support tumor control of vestibular schwannomas (VS) after gamma knife\\nradiosurgery. Here, the detection during treatment can be exploited to correlate the cancer with pre-treatment growth\\nrate to measure eﬀectivity of the radiosurgery. A similar case occurs with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA),\\nwhich is the fourth leading cause of cancer-related death with a 5-year survival rate in the western world. While surgery\\nis currently the only potentially curative therapy, only 15-20% of the patients are considered for resection, since the rest\\nof the patients have an advanced stage of cancer for which curative surgery treatment is too late. Here, preoperatively\\npredicting the prognosis of PDA is important in the determination of the most appropriate treatment strategy.\\nIn all of the above cases, cancer detection based on advanced image analysis is crucial to determine the character-\\nization and behavior of the cancer to come to prediction of the treatment and/or resection decisions. The usefulness\\nof computer-aided support for analysis of the disease has passed the point of discussion, but the reliable detection of\\nspeciﬁc forms of cancer still depends on applied types of imaging and the search for the best image features describing\\nthe cancerous tissue properties is still ongoing. In this paper we discuss the exploration of various image features to\\nsupport a reliable and robust detection.\\nIn the BE study, several popular computer vision methods for detection are evaluated. Furthermore, we introduce\\nnew, clinically-inspired features and compare the detection performance of the investigated methods to that of clinical\\nendoscopic and VLE experts. Typical features for evaluation are spectral features like multi-directional Gabor wavelets\\nand statistical features like the Gray-Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM), Local Binary Patterns (LBP), Histogram\\nof Oriented Gradients (HOG) features as well as features from the Fully Connected (FC) layers of ALexNet as used\\nin Deep Learning. With a maximal Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.95 for the proposed features versus an AUC of\\n0.81 for the VLE experts, this study shows that computer-aided detection methods oﬀer a quite promising technique\\nfor the interpretation of VLE data [1].\\nFor VS detection in the brain, in an initial study Tumor Volume Doubling Time (VDT) prior to treatment was\\ncalculated using pretreatment MRI scan, at least 6 months before treatment, and the treatment MRI scan. Objective\\ncriteria of failure were applied, based on tumor volumes: after initial pseudo-progression period of 2 years, showing\\ntwice a volumetric tumor progression of at least 10%, consecutively. VDTs were correlated with observed tumor control\\nrates and volumetric responses.\\nFor PDA detection, we present the ﬁrst experiments for automated determination of resectability using CT scans.\\nThe tumor features are extracted from a group of patients with both hypo- and iso-attenuating tumors of which 33 were\\nresectable and 37 were not. The tumor contours are supplied by a medical expert. We present an approach that uses\\nintensity, shape, and texture features to determine tumor resectability. A broad set of statistical features is compared\\nand various feature selection algorithms are exploited to ﬁnd the best descriptors. It was found that Logistic Regression\\nof the feature vector containing a broad set of statistical features was the best to be combined with a decision tree\\nalgorithm, in order to obtain the highest classiﬁcation result. Compared to expert predictions made on a similar data\\nset, our method reaches better classiﬁcation results, but the data set is still limited. We obtain up to 28% gain on\\ncorrectly predicting non-resectability, which is essential for patient treatment.\\nReferences\\n[1] S.

INTRODUCTION\\nThe advent of recent powerful neural networks (NN) trig-\\ngered explosive spread of research activities and applica-\\ntions on deep neural networks (DNN). The DNN also have\\nfound many practical applications such as image recognition,\\nspeech recognition and robotics because of their excellent\\nperformance compared with traditional methods. For example,\\nin image recognition competitions, it was recently shown\\nthat deep neural networks achieves recognition performance\\ncomparable to that of human. It is natural to exploit the\\npotential of DNN for data compression applications. In this\\npaper, we study a lossy encoding scheme based on binarized\\nautoencoder. The proposed method is well matched to neural\\nnetwork-based pattern classiﬁers.\\nII. AUTOENCODERS\\nAutoencoders are a well known class of neural networks.\\nAn autoencoder is trained so that squared Euclidean distances\\nbetween inputs and outputs becomes small. Combined with a\\nsuitable regulation terms in the loss function, we can obtain\\na special representation of inputs at the hidden layer such as\\nsparse representation of inputs.\\nThe architecture of autoencoder with 3-layers are the fol-\\nlowing. Let x ∈Rn be the input to the network. The values\\nof the hidden layer are given by h = f(Wx + b) where\\nW ∈Rm×n is a weight matrix and b ∈Rm is a bias vector.\\nThe function f : R →R is a nonlinear function called an\\nactivation function. The values of the output layers are given\\nby ˆx = ˆf( ˆWx + ˆb) where ˆW ∈Rm×n and ˆb ∈Rm. The\\nfunction ˆf : R →R is also an activation function. The set of\\nparameters Θ = {W, ˆW, b, ˆb} are adjusted in a training phase\\nso as to minimize the loss function ||x −ˆx||2\\n2 or another loss\\nfunction.\\nIII. BINALIZED AUTOENCODER\\nThe proposed lossy encoder consists of an autoencoder with\\na binary quantization hidden layer, which is called a binalized\\nautoencoder. The values of hidden layer are quantized as h =\\nsign(Wx + b). The function sign(a) gives value 1 if a ≥0;\\notherwise it takes the value 0. We also introduce constraint\\nW = ˆW T . The vector h can be considered as a compressed\\ncoded sequence corresponding to the input x\\nIV. COMPUTER EXPERIMENTS\\nWe performed computer experiments for evaluating the\\ncompression performance of the proposed scheme. As a\\ndataset, we used the MNIST handwritten number dataset in\\nthe experiments. A pixel data in the MNIST dataset has\\n784 pixels (28 × 28) and each white-black pixel has 8-bit\\ndepth. In this experiments, we used the sigmoid function\\nσ(a) = 1/(1 + exp(−a)) at the output layer, i.e., ˆf = σ. The\\nloss function used in the training process is the cross entropy\\nfunction deﬁned by\\n−1\\nnNt\\n!\\ni∈Dt\\nn\\n!\\nj=0\\n{x(i)\\nj log ˆx(i)\\nj\\n+ (1 −x(i)\\nj ) log(1 −ˆx(i)\\nj )},\\nwhere Dt is the t-th mini-batch and Nt denotes the number\\nof data items in the mini-batch Dt. In the experiments, we\\ncompressed randomly chosen pixel data from the MSNIT\\ndataset and measured the compression rate and successful\\nrecognition rate. As a pattern classiﬁer, a convolutional neural\\nnetwork with successful recognition rate 99.4% was used.\\nFigure 1 summarizes results of the computer experiments.\\nThe horizontal axis of Fig.1 represents the compression rate\\nand the vertical axis indicates the successful recognition rate.\\nThe parameters used in the experiments are the following:\\nNt = 100, learning coefﬁcient 0.25, the number of learning\\nepochs 50000. The ﬁgure indicates that the proposed lossy\\nencoder achieves successful recognition rate 97.8% with the\\ncompression rate 3.99%.

For lossy data compression the celebrated\\nRate-Distortion theory provides the compression rate in order to\\nquantize a signal without exceeding a given distortion measure.\\nRecently, with the Information Bottleneck method an alternative\\napproach has been emerged in the ﬁeld of machine learning\\nand has been successfully applied for data processing. The\\nfundamental idea is to include the original source into the\\nproblem setup when quantizing an observation variable and\\nto use strictly information theoretic measures to design the\\nquantizer. This paper introduces this framework and discusses\\nalgorithmic implementations for the quantizer design.\\nI. EXTENDED ABSTRACT\\nA fundamental task in data processing is the quantized\\nrepresentation of noisy observations of an original source\\nsignal. Fig. 1 shows the considered system model consisting\\nof a data source, a transmission channel and a quantizer.\\ndata source\\nquantizer\\nchannel\\ny ∈Y\\nz ∈Z\\nx ∈X\\np(y|x)\\np(z|y)\\np(x)\\nFig. 1. General system model for the quantization of noisy observations\\nWithout loss of generality, we assume the random variable\\nx with realizations x ∈X following the probability mass\\nfunction (pmf) p(x) as a discrete memoryless source (DMS).\\nThe observation variable y with realizations y ∈Y is the\\noutput of a discrete memoryless channel (DMC) characterized\\nby its transition probability distribution p(y|x). Furthermore,\\nthe random variable z with realizations z ∈Z is the output\\nof the quantizer block being characterized by the conditional\\ndistribution p(z|y). Thus, the quantizer output z is a compact\\nrepresentation of y with cardinality |Z| ≤|Y|. The design\\nof the quantizer p(z|y) realizes a trade-off between the\\ncompression rate, I(y; z), and the quality of the compressed\\nrepresentation.\\nThe Rate-Distortion (RD) theory provides the minimal\\nnumber of bits per symbol in order to represent the received\\nsignal without exceeding an upper-bound on a given distortion\\nmeasure, e.g., the mean square error (MSE) between the\\nquantizer input signal and its representative at the output\\n[1]. Speciﬁcally, the Blahut-Arimoto algorithm determines the\\nlowest achievable compression rate for a certain maximum\\ntolerable distortion. The main drawbacks of this formulation\\nare the lack of a systematic way to choose a proper distortion\\nmeasure for any case of pertinence and the fact, that the\\nstochastic relation between the noisy observation and the\\noriginal data source is not considered.\\nIn [2], Tishby et al. have introduced the Information Bot-\\ntleneck (IB) method for data compression. The central idea\\nis to compress the observation y such that the quantizer\\noutput z preserves most of the information about the relevant\\nvariable, i.e., the original source x. Furthermore, IB avoids the\\na priori speciﬁcation of a distortion measure by considering\\nthe mutual information I(x; z) between the quantizer output\\nand the original data source. In this fashion, the output of the\\nquantizer becomes a compact representation of its input which\\nis highly informative about the actual source of interest.\\nGiven the joint probability distribution of the source and\\nthe channel output p(x, y) = p(x) p(y|x) and assuming\\nx ↔y ↔z to be a Markov chain, the quantizer should be\\ndesigned such that the output z is a compact representation\\nof the input y which is highly informative about x. Mathe-\\nmatically, the existent trade-off between the compression rate,\\nI(y; z), and the relevant information, I(x; z), is established\\nby the introduction of a non-negative Lagrange multiplier, β,\\nin the design formulation. Hence, for an allowed number of\\nquantizer output levels, n, the corresponding design problem\\nfollows as [2]\\np⋆(z|y)=argmin\\np(z|y)\\n1\\nβ+1\\n!\\nI(y; z)−βI(x; z)\\n\"\\nfor |Z|≤n . (1)\\nThe optimal quantizer mapping for (1) can be derived by\\nmeans of variational calculus. Explicitly, for a speciﬁc value\\nof β the mapping p(z|y) is a stationary point of the objective\\nfunction in (1), if and only if\\np(z|y) =\\np(z)\\nψ(y, β)e−βDKL(p(x|y)∥p(x|z))\\n(2)\\nis met for all pairs (y, z) ∈Y × Z.

The derived optimal mapping in (2) has an implicit\\nform, as the cluster representative (in a conventional sense)\\np(x|z) and the cluster probability p(z) appearing on the right\\nside of (2), depend on the quantizer mapping p(z|y) by\\np(z) =\\n#\\ny∈Y\\np(y) p(z|y)\\n(3)\\n13\\n13\\nand\\np(x|z) =\\n1\\np(z)\\n!\\ny∈Y\\np(x, y) p(z|y) .\\n(4)\\nThe iterative calculation of (2)-(4) leads to the Iterative In-\\nformation Bottleneck (It-IB) algorithm [2].

Kurkoski\\nJapan Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Nomi, Japan\\nEmail: kurkoski@jaist.ac.jp\\nThe max-LUT method is an approach for implementing factor graph-based decoders and detectors using lookup\\ntables (LUTs). In factor graphs, nodes compute output messages as a function of input messages. In the max-LUT\\nmethod, these functions are implemented by LUTs, rather than by conventional mathematical operations. The LUT is\\ndesigned to maximize mutual information between the output message and the information symbol it represents; this\\nis a natural choice since maximizing mutual information leads to the highest achievable communications rates. The\\nentire system is assumed to be discrete, since LUTs themselves produce discrete outputs from discrete inputs.\\nThe max-LUT method is especially appealing for hardware implementations. For example, factor-graph LDPC\\ndecoders are commonly implemented in VLSI with ﬁxed-precision arithmetic. Engineers often take a time-consuming\\ntrial-and-error approach to designing such decoders. The max-LUT method provides a systematic approach to design\\nsuch decoders. In practice, such decoders have very good performance, when compared to other decoders of similar\\nprecision. Another example is implementation of computer simulations - the max-LUT method signiﬁcantly reduces\\nthe simulation time of LDPC decoding algorithms.\\nConsider a general degree-three factor-graph node, Fig. 1. The factor graph node expresses a relationship f between\\nthree random variables X1, X2 and X3, which are code symbols; this encoder-side perspective is shown in Fig. 1-(a).\\nThe factor graph node also has a decoder-side perspective, shown in Fig. 1-(b). Three random variables L, Z and V are\\nmessages about the code symbols X1, X2 and X3, respectively, where L and Z are inputs and V is the output. In the\\ncase of a binary LDPC code check node, the function f expresses f(X1, X2) = X1 + X2 with modulo-two arithmetic.\\nIn the case of an binary LDPC variable node, the function f expresses:\\nf(X1, X2) =\\n!\\nX1\\nif X1 = X2\\nundeﬁned\\nif X1 ̸= X2\\n.\\n(1)\\nThe conditional distributions pL|X1(ℓ|x1) and pZ|X2(z|x2) are known. This may be obtained from the channel noise\\nmodel, for example.\\nX1\\nX2\\nX3\\nf\\nL\\nZ\\nV\\nLUT\\n(a) Encoder Side\\n(b) Decoder Side\\nFig. 1: (a) Encoder-side representation of a factor graph. (b) Decoder-side representation of factor graph.\\nWith these inputs, the max-LUT method proceeds as follows, and is shown in Fig. 2. It is straightforward to\\nconstruct the conditional distribution pL,Z|X3(ℓ, z|x3) from the given conditional distributions and f. It is desired to\\nﬁnd a function LUT which computes a new variable v from the input variables ℓ, z:\\nv = LUT(ℓ, z).\\n(2)\\nTo do this, ﬁnd the LUT* which maximizes mutual information I(V ; X3) :\\nLUT* = arg max\\nLUT\\nI(V ; X3) or\\n(3)\\n= arg max\\nLUT\\nI(LUT(L, Z); X3).\\n(4)\\nThis maximization problem is equivalent to designing a quantizer for a discrete memoryless channel, and is connected\\nwith the classiﬁcation problem in machine learning.

Moreover, the mapping from (ℓ, z) to v provided by the\\nquantizer gives the lookup table LUT.\\nThere are various approaches to ﬁnd LUT. When the Xi are binary, there is an optimal dynamic programming\\napproach. When Xi are non-binary, eﬃcient but suboptimal approaches such as the information bottleneck method,\\nor the KL-means algorithm (which is the K-means algorithm with Kullback-Leiber divergence metric).\\nThe above method has been applied to decoding of LDPC codes. In a typical case the size of the alphabets |L| =\\n|Z| = |V| = 16 (corresponding to 4 bits/message), gives performance that is similar to ﬂoating point messages on the\\nfactor graph.\\n16\\nAn Information Bottleneck LDPC Decoder on a DSP\\nJan Lewandowsky, e-mail: jan.lewandowsky@tuhh.de\\nHamburg University of Technology, Institute of Communications, 21073 Hamburg, Germany\\nScope and Motivation: Recently, discrete message passing decoders for low-density parity-check (LDPC)\\ncodes have attracted some attention [1, 2]. Discrete LDPC decoders are designed using mutual information\\nmaximizing clustering algorithms, such as the Information Bottleneck method, in a discrete density evolution\\nscheme. The clustering algorithms are applied to obtain lookup tables for all decoder iterations. These lookup\\ntables replace the classical check node and variable node operations in the decoder. Software deﬁned radio (SDR)\\nplatforms play an important role in modern communications because they oﬀer very high ﬂexibility. On an SDR\\nplatform, most parts of the signal processing chain are implemented in software that is run on a digital signal\\nprocessor (DSP), a general purpose processor (GPP) or heterogeneous hardware. The aim of the presented work\\nwas to validate the assumption that the integer based decoding process in discrete decoders which results from\\npurely information theoretical considerations also oﬀers practical gains in a decoder implementation suitable for\\nSDR applications. For this purpose, a discrete decoder was implemented on a Texas Instruments TMS3206474\\nDSP using a TMDSEVM6474L evaluation board and compared with several state-of-the-art message passing\\ndecoders on the same hardware.\\nChallenges: Naturally, memory addressing and memory access latency have strong inﬂuence on the de-\\ncoding throughput of discrete decoders.\\nThe DSP natively supports standard 8, 16 and 32 bit data types.\\nHowever, discrete LDPC decoders show very good performance also with shorter messages. A bit width of 4\\nbit is suﬃcient to perform very close to double precision belief propagation decoders for binary input additive\\nwhite Gaussian noise (AWGN) channels. Embedding 4 bit data in standard data types requires additional\\noperations for bitﬁeld extraction. It was a challenge to ﬁnd a good trade-oﬀbetween memory usage of the\\ndecoder and fast memory access. We developed a technique which accepts larger lookup tables for a simpler\\naddressing operation of the lookup table entries in the decoder. Moreover, we studied several methods to obtain\\na decoder implementation with a small memory footprint. The lookup tables holding the decoding mappings for\\nall decoder iterations are accessed extremely often during the iterative decoding process. The TMS320C6474\\nDSP is not especially optimized for fast memory access. However, we found it to be beneﬁcial for the discrete\\nLDPC decoding process that the DSP has the huge number of 32 registers. It was a challenge to develop a\\ndiscrete decoder implementation which makes use of this strength of the selected hardware platform.\\n0\\n1\\n2\\n3\\n4\\n5\\n0\\n200\\n400\\n600\\ndiscrete decoder\\n4 bit messages\\nmin-sum with\\njacobian log.\\nmin-sum\\nEb/N0 [dB]\\nnet decoding throughput [kbit/s]\\nFigure 1: Decoding throughput of several it-\\nerative decoders on the TMS320C6474 DSP.\\nResults: The novel discrete LDPC decoder was tested for a\\nquantized output AWGN channel with binary phase shift keying\\nmodulation and exemplary (3, 6)-regular LDPC codes for vary-\\ning Eb/N0.

Email: Hirosuke@ieee.org\\nIt is well known from Kraft’s and McMillan’s theorems\\nthat the Huffman code, which is optimal in the class of\\ninstantaneous codes (i.e. preﬁx codes), is also optimal in the\\nclass of uniquely decodable codes if a ﬁxed single code tree is\\nused. However, AIFV (almost instantaneous ﬁxed-to-variable\\nlength) codes were proposed recently [1], [2], which uses\\ntwo (resp. K −1) code trees for the binary (resp. K-ary)\\ncode alphabet, and it was shown that the AIFV codes can\\nattain better compression rate than the Huffman codes for\\ni.i.d. sources. Since source symbols are assigned to incomplete\\ninternal nodes in addition to leaves in the AIFV codes, they\\nare not instantaneous codes. But, they are devised so that the\\ndecoding delay is at most 2 bits (resp. one code symbol) for\\nthe binary (resp. K-ary) codes. Hence the codes are called\\nalmost instantaneous.\\nThe average code length of the binary Huffman code LH is\\nbounded by H(X) ≤LH < H(X) + 1, and the upper bound\\nis tight when pmax →1, where pmax is the probability of\\nthe most probable source symbol, i.e. pmax = maxx∈X p(x).\\nOn the other hand, the average code length of the optimal\\nbinary AIFV code LAIFV is bounded by H(X) ≤LAIFV <\\nH(X)+0.5 and the upper bound is tight when pmax →1 [3].\\nNote that LH cannot become shorter than one in any case, but\\nLAIFV can become shorter than one when pmax is large.\\nThe binary AIFV codes, which use two code trees and have\\nat most 2-bit decoding delay, can be extended to the binary\\nAIFV-m codes, which use m code trees and have at most\\nm-bit decoding delay for m ≥2. The binary AIFV-2 codes\\ncorrespond to the original binary AIFV codes. Furthermore,\\nit is proved that the average length of the optimal AIFV-m\\ncode LAIFV-m is bounded by H(X) ≤LAIFV-m < H(X) + 1\\nm\\nfor 2 ≤m ≤4 [3]. We note that the Huffman codes for\\nextended alphabet X m can also attain the same bound. But, in\\nthe case of Huffman codes for X m, the size of the code tree is\\nO(|X|m) and the largest decoding delay becomes much larger\\nthan m bits for the ﬁrst symbol of xm ∈X m since m source\\nsymbols xm are decoded at once. In contrast, in the case of\\nthe AIFV-m codes, the total size of code trees is O(m|X|)\\nand the decoding delay is at most m bits. Hence, the AIFV-m\\ncodes are superior to the Huffman codes for X m in terms of\\nmemory size and decoding delay.\\nFor a given source, the optimal AIFV code can be con-\\nstructed by an iterative optimization algorithm combined with\\ninteger programing [2] or dynamic programming [4]. Fur-\\nthermore, the optimal binary AIFV-m code trees can also be\\nconstructed by the iterative optimization algorithm combined\\nwith a dynamic programming algorithm of time complexity\\nO(mn2m+1) and space complexity O(mnm+1) for 2 ≤m ≤\\n5, where n = |X| [5].\\nFor sources with n = |X|, the total number of binary\\nHuffman code trees is given by the (n−1)-th Catalan number\\nCn−1 while the total number of binary AIFV code trees is\\ngiven by the (n −1)-th large Schr¨oder number Sn−1, which\\nis the total number of Schr¨oder paths [6]. Since it holds that\\nlog2 Cn = 2n+o(n) and log2 Sn = n log2(3+2\\n√\\n2)+o(n) ≈\\n2.5431n + o(n), binary AIFV codes have a great variety of\\ncode trees compared with Huffman codes. Since there is a\\nbijection between the set of binary AIFV code trees and the\\nset of Schr¨oder paths, each AIFV code tree can be represented\\nwith ⌈log2 Sn−1⌉bits by using the bijection [6].\\nIf the probability distribution of a source is unknown, we\\ncan use the adaptive (dynamic) Huffman code instead of the\\nstatic Huffman code. In the case of AIFV codes, it is very\\ndifﬁcult to obtain an algorithm to update code trees adaptively\\nand optimally for given source sequences. However, it is\\nshown that (non-optimal) binary AIFV code trees can easily be\\nconstructed from the Huffman code tree by applying a certain\\noperation to each pair of sibling with a leaf such that the\\nprobability weight of the leaf is more than twice as large as the\\none of the other sibling node [3]. Hence, adaptive AIFV coding\\ncan be realized by the AIFV code trees derived from the\\nHuffman code tree which is updated adaptively by the dynamic\\nHuffman algorithm. For source sequences with pmax > 0.5,\\nthe above adaptive AIFV code can improve compression rate\\nconsiderably compared with the dynamic Huffman code [7].\\nREFERENCES\\n[1] H. Yamamoto and X.

The target applications cover\\nmainly Indoor low bite rate communication services for home automation and building control. Important industrial\\ndevelopment has been carried out to produce and deploy NB-PLC in the low frequency band less than 500 kHz by\\nusing single carrier modulations. Multiple standards BACnet [1], KNX (ISO/IEC 14543-3-5, EN 50090) [2], and LON\\n(ISO/IEC 14908-3, ANSI 709.2) [3], [4] have been released and are being considered for future Smart Home services.\\nThis category of NB-PLC is not succeeding to reach the great commercial success through mass deployment mainly\\ndue to the strong competition of low-cost short range wireless solutions.\\nToday, the massive IoT deployment by using wireless technology is facing the big challenge of limited radio spectrum\\nresources and more restrictive EMC regulation that is limiting the indoor radio propagation inside buildings. This\\noﬀers an important opportunity to promote NB-PLC that will allow relaxing the occupation of the radio spectrum\\nand overcome indoor poor radio propagation issues. Following the top-down modelling approach, a new parametric\\nmodel was proposed for the narrowband PLC channel transfer function taking into account power lines transmission\\ncharacteristics at the low frequency range. The proposed model was validated through ﬁeld measurements in the\\nCENELEC/FCC/ARIB bands using the Matrix Pencil algorithm for model parameters identiﬁcation. The statistical\\ndistributions of the model parameters were then determined allowing the random generation of narrowband PLC\\nchannels which are in good agreement with the experimental ones.\\nThis observation is motivating our research work within the framework of a Tunisian-German scientiﬁc collaboration\\nproject to propose an optimized design of a NB-PLC Modem by exploring the eﬃcient and robust single carrier\\nmodulation combined with a low-complexity channel coding scheme. In order to adapt the modulation technique to the\\ntarget indoor powerline environment in the CENELEC (9-490 kHz), FCC (9-490 kHz) and ARIB (9-450 kHz) bands, the\\nPLC channel frequency response in the presence of background and impulse noise are considered to compare modulation\\ntechniques and deﬁne the optimal demodulation processing architecture [5], [6]. Obtained simulation results, by using\\nmeasured indoor channel frequency response and noise, are showing superior performances with M-ary FSK combined\\nwith permutation code [7].

SUMMARY\\nIn this talk, we revisit a folklore which is stated as follows:1\\nGiven a good variable-length lossless code with\\ncodeword length ℓn(xn) for each xn ∈X n, the set\\nCn = {xn : ℓn(xn) ≤nR} of sequences for which\\nthe codeword length ℓn(xn) is smaller than or equal\\nto the given threshold nR gives a good ﬁxed-length\\ncode with the coding rate R.\\nIn the statement above, the goodness of codes is not well de-\\nﬁned. The purpose of this study is to give precise formulation\\nfor this folklore. In particular, we consider this problem from\\nthe aspect of universal source coding [2], [3].\\nIn summary, we apply universal ﬁxed-to-variable length\\n(FV) lossless codes to\\n(1) ﬁxed-to-ﬁxed length (FF) coding allowing non-vanishing\\nerror probability, as known as ε-FF coding, and\\n(2) FV coding allowing non-vanishing error probability, as\\nknown as ε-FV coding.\\nOur results demonstrate that we can construct a universal ε-FF\\ncode and a universal ε-FV code from a universal FV lossless\\ncode.2\\nII. KEY IDEA (“CONCEPT” OF THIS TALK)\\nThe results of this talk depend heavily on the result of Koga\\nand Yamamoto [6, Theorem 2]: Assume that the codeword\\nlength ℓn(xn) of an FV lossless code satisﬁes,3 for an infor-\\nmation source X = {Xn}∞\\nn=1,\\n1\\nnE [ℓn(Xn)] −1\\nnH(Xn) →0\\n(n →∞),\\nwhere H(Xn) denotes the entropy of Xn. Then, under a\\ncertain condition,\\n1\\nnℓn(Xn) −1\\nn log\\n1\\nPXn(Xn) →0\\n1The connection between the error probability of FF codes and the overﬂow\\nprobability of FV codes, which is shown by Uchida and Han [1], gives a\\ntheoretical support for this folklore.\\n2A similar problem was studied by the author [4], [5], where relations\\nbetween universal FV coding and FF coding with vanishing error probability\\nare investigated. In this sense, this paper gives a slight generalization of [4],\\n[5].\\n3It may be worth to note that the codeword length of an FV lossless code\\ncan be characterized by an integer-valued function ℓn(xn) satisfying the Kraft\\ninequality !\\nxn 2−ℓn(xn) ≤1.\\nin probability as n →∞, where PXn denotes the probability\\ndistribution of Xn.\\nRoughly speaking, the above result guarantees that we can\\napproximate the entropy-spectrum of the source (i.e., the dis-\\ntribution of the entropy density rate (1/n) log(1/PXn(Xn)))\\nby using the distribution of the codeword length per symbol\\nℓn(Xn)/n.\\nBased on this fact, we can demonstrate the following results:\\n(1) If there exists a universal FV lossless code for a set of\\nsources Ωthen the set Cn = {xn : ℓn(xn) ≤nR}\\nof sequences for which the codeword length ℓn(xn) is\\nsmaller than or equal to the given threshold nR gives a\\nuniversal FF code allowing errors for Ω.\\n(2) Let us construct an FV code with codeword length ˆℓn(xn)\\nsuch that\\n(i)\\nˆℓn(xn) =\\n!\\n1 + ℓn(xn)\\nif xn ∈Cn\\n1\\notherwise.\\n(ii) All xn ∈Cn can be reconstructed at the decoder.\\nThen, the constructed FV code can achieves the optimal\\ntrade-off between the average codeword length and the\\nerror probability universally for Ω.\\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\\nThis work was supported by JSPS KAKENHI Grant Num-\\nber 26820145.\\nREFERENCES\\n[1] O.

It turns out that we may indeed\\nobtain useful results using information-theoretic methods, if\\nwe are able to deﬁne an operational means of what is relevant.\\nAn example could be a data base of a machine M, which\\ncontains the ”class” y of M as a function of time t, where in\\nthe remainder the class y ∈{0, 1} is assumed to be binary,\\nand it corresponds to M being ”up” or ”down”. Furthermore,\\nthe data base contains the recordings of many sensors ¯x of\\nM (often called ”features” in data science), also as a function\\nof time t. For notational convenience, we henceforth use the\\nnotation x for the random variables corresponding to the\\nrecording of the features, both for the scalar and the vector\\ncase. The relevant information to be extracted from the data\\nbase can now, for example, be deﬁned as ﬁnding a possibly\\nsimple predictive model that is able to predict reliably the\\nclass y of machine M at some point in the future, given the\\nrecorded realizations of all sensors x in the past up to the\\ncurrent time t0. Mathematically, one is looking in this case\\nfor a possibly simple p(y|x), which represents a stochastic\\nfunction of how y depends on the features x.\\nIt turns out that very often, most of the information in\\nthe data base is of little or no importance in establishing\\nsuch a model. A major part of the time of a data analist\\nis devoted to establishing which components of x might be\\nrelevant for predicting y, and how to quantize and combine\\nthese components in a useful, relatively simple model.\\nInformation-theoretic methods, as explained hereafter, may\\nactually formalize these procedures in an optimal and auto-\\nmated manner. As mentioned before, these procedures should\\nbe able to discard most of the available information in the data\\nbase, e.g.,\\n• non-relevant information,\\n• too much detail,\\n• noise,\\n• errors,\\nin such a manner, that the relevant information is presented in\\na concise and useful model. As we explain in the remainder,\\nsuch discarding while retaining the relevant information, can\\nbe seen as a form of quantization of the data base.\\nIn a seminal article, Tishby et al. propose the Information\\nBottleneck Method [1]. In this paper, the authors present an\\ninformation-theoretic way of quantifying the concept ”retain-\\ning relevant information” in a useful manner. Their way of\\nthinking can be seen as an extension of rate distortion theory.\\nClassical rate distortion theory sets information-theoretic\\nbounds on what can be achieved by (vector) quantizers in\\nterms of a trade-off between distortion of a source signal\\nand the bit rate for representing the source [2], [3]. Also\\nin the Information Bottleneck method, retaining of relevant\\ninformation is approached by assuming that such can be\\nachieved by a proper quantization of the data base, which we\\nfrom now on call ”Tishby quantization”.\\nIn rate distortion theory, a rate distortion function R(D) is\\nintroduced, which provides a bound on the performance of\\n(vector) quantizers for a given source, in terms of a minimal\\naverage distortion D that is attainable for a certain average bit\\nrate R. Let’s assume that a ﬁxed vector quantizer Q maps the\\nsignal x onto a quantized version x′, Q : x \"→x′. In classical\\nrate distortion theory, known distortion measures are e.g.:\\n• Euclidean distance: dE(x, x′) = ||x −x′||2,\\n• Hamming distance: dH(x, x′) = wt(x−x′), where wt(z)\\ncorresponds to the number on non-zero components of z.\\nIn classical rate distortion theory, everything revolves around\\nthe variables x, its quantized version x′, and a distortion that\\nonly depends on x and x′.\\nIn the setting of predicting y using a set of quantized\\nfeatures x′, i.e., generating a ”good” p(y|x′), the idea put\\nforward by Tishby et al., is to deﬁne a Kullback-Leibler (KL)\\ndistortion measure on p(y|x′), where now the random variable\\ny also is included. Tishby et al. deﬁne\\nd(y)\\nKL(x, x′) =\\n!\\ny\\np(y|x) log p(y|x)\\np(y|x′),\\n(1)\\nwhere the distortion d(y)\\nKL(x, x′) reﬂects the loss of relevant\\ninformation concerning y when features x′ are used for\\npredicting y in stead of using features x. As mentioned before,\\none may think of x′ as being (vector) quantized versions of x.\\nIn Fig. 1, we depict an example of the idea of Tishby\\nquantization in a block diagram. In the example, the subject\\nof interest is a machine M that is characterized by a class\\ny (”up” or ”down”) as a function of time. Furthermore, M\\noutputs a set of features x as a function of time. We have not\\nindicated the time t explicitly, as we may be interested in the\\ninformation that past realizations of x may provide about the\\ncurrent y. Moreover, different components of the vector x may\\n25\\n25\\n2\\nrefer to the same physical sensor taken at different times in\\nthe past.\\nFig. 1: Example of Tishby Quantization\\nThe mutual information I(X; Y ) corresponds to the average\\namount of relevant information that realizations of the features\\nx may provide about the class y. If we quantize features x\\ninto x′, we incur a KL-distortion d(y)\\nKL(x, x′) as given by (1).\\nAccording to rate distortion theory [3], there exist quantizers\\nQ : x !→x′ that on average only need a rate R(D) bits per\\ntransmission for representing the signal x with an average KL-\\ndistortion at most D, where\\nR(D) =\\nmin\\np(x′|x):!\\nx,x′ p(x)p(x′|x)·d(y)\\nKL(x,x′)≤D\\nI(X; X′).\\n(2)\\nIf the quantizer is deterministic, we have in addition\\nH(X′|X) = 0\\n⇒\\nI(X; X′) = H(X′).\\n(3)\\nAs a result from Tishby quantization, we ﬁnally have an efﬁ-\\ncient description x′ of new features that can be extracted from\\nthe data base, costing on average H(X′) bits per realization for\\ntransmission (or storage), with the corresponding p(y|x′) for\\npredicting the class y using x′, which still provides the largest\\npossible amount of information I(X′; Y ) concerning the class\\ny of machine M (given that we started with features x).\\nKullback-Leibler Distortion\\nThe Kullback-Leibler distortion (1) or information diver-\\ngence [3], [4] between the conditional distributions p(y|x) and\\np(y|x′) is a measure for the amount of bits of information that\\nis lost, if one uses x′ to predict y in stead of x. One can show\\neasily that\\nEx,x′\\n!\\nd(y)\\nKL(x, x′)\\n\"\\n= I(X; Y ) −I(X′; Y ),\\n(4)\\nhence, the average KL-distortion between p(y|x) and p(y|x′)\\nequals the loss in average mutual information about Y due to\\nthe quantization of x into x′, where Y is the relevant quantity\\nof the data base.\\nModiﬁed Lloyd Algorithm\\nTishby et al. [1] discuss information-theoretic consequences\\nof their approach, in particular of ﬁnding bounds that cor-\\nrespond to a rate-distortion function R(D). For ﬁnding (an\\napproximation to) a Tishby quantizer of a realization of an\\nunknown data source, one may consider a modiﬁcation of the\\nwell-known extended Lloyd algorithm [5], as is also discussed\\nby [6], [7]. The modiﬁed Lloyd algorithm is an iterative\\nalgorithm, containing three steps in each iteration, which also\\nallows for estimating the cost of transmission:\\n1) given a partitioning of x, ﬁnd the best representative x′\\nin each partition:\\nx′ = argminx′′Ex∈partition\\n!\\nd(y)\\nKL(x, x′′)\\n\"\\n(5)\\n2) given a partitioning of x and the resulting p(x′) on\\nthe representatives of the partitioned x, ﬁnd the length\\ndistribution l of an optimal variable length code:\\nl(x′) = −log p(x′)\\n(6)\\n3) given the representatives x′, ﬁnd the best partitioning by\\nassigning each data point x to the representative x′ that\\nminimizes:\\nd(y)\\nKL(x, x′) + λ · l(x′)\\n(7)\\nwhere λ is a Lagrange parameter balancing the costs of\\ndistortion and transmission.\\nBy picking λ, we can choose between a course quantization\\nleading to a short description x′ of the features, that has a\\nrelatively high loss of information concerning y (λ large),\\nor a longer description resulting from a ﬁner quantization\\nthat contains much more detail concerning y (λ small). Of\\ncourse, the information-theoretic interesting aspect is to ﬁnd\\nthe largest possible I(X′; Y ) for a given average description\\nlength H(X′). Note that the extended Lloyd algorithm can\\nbe applied both on a scalar x (scalar quantization), and on a\\nvector x (vector quantization).\\nTypically, the modiﬁed Lloyd algorithm starts off in a\\nspace x of high-resolution quantized features, where in each\\nbin of the space the relevant probabilities p(x|y), p(x) and\\np(y|x) can be deﬁned, estimated or computed. The algorithm\\nsubsequently performs an optimal partitioning of this space\\ninto K regions x′ by a clustering of the high-resolution bins x.\\nIt seems that both the number K and a good initial location\\nof x′ must be found experimentally.\\nREFERENCES\\n[1] N.Tishby, F.C.

It is well known that MPC is important for applications of cryptography, e.g., for computing statistics of\\ncloud data. MPC is also fascinating for understanding and enjoying cryptography since it can be implemented by\\nusing a deck of playing cards [1], which is called “card-based cryptographic protocol”. We address in this talk a card-\\nbased cryptographic protocol for secure comparison of two numbers, called millionaires’ problem, which is a traditional\\nproblem in MPC initiated by Yao’s seminal work [2].\\nOur original motivation presented in [3] is to propose eﬃcient card-based cryptographic protocols for millionaires’\\nproblem in terms of MPC, i.e., communication complexities and number of cards used in the protocol. In this talk,\\nhowever, we rather focus on an interesting relation between the proposed protocol and a famous logic puzzle “The fork\\nin the road” (e.g., see [4]), which was ﬁrstly pointed in [3].\\nIn the proposed protocol, we assume that the wealth of Alice and Bob is represented by bits, and they execute\\nbitwise comparisons for their wealth. In each bitwise comparison, Alice sends her bit or its negation to Bob without\\ntelling him which one of them is sent. Even if she tells a lie on her bit, it is possible to compare her bit with Bob’s one\\nby introducing a technique borrowed from “The fork in the road.”\\nAcknowledgement\\nThis work was supported by JSPS KAKENHI Grant Numbers JP26420345, JP15H02710, and JP17H01752.\\nReferences\\n[1] B. den Boer, “More eﬃcient match making and satisﬁability: the ﬁve card trick,” in Advances in Cryptology - CRYPTO’93, LNCS773,\\npp. 208-217, Springer-Verlag, 1990.\\n[2] A.Yao, “Protocols for secure computations,” IEEE Symposium on FOCS, vol. 23 pp. 160-164, IEEE, 1982.\\n[3] T.

This growth accelerated further after 2017 with the transformer architecture. In the 2020s, an ongoing period of rapid progress in advanced generative AI became known as the AI boom. Generative AI\\'s ability to create and modify content has led to several unintended consequences and harms. Ethical concerns have been raised about AI\\'s long-term effects and potential existential risks, prompting discussions about regulatory policies to ensure the safety and benefits of the technology.\\n\\n\\n== Goals ==\\nThe general problem of simulating (or creating) intelligence has been broken into subproblems. These consist of particular traits or capabilities that researchers expect an intelligent system to display. The traits described below have received the most attention and cover the scope of AI research.\\n\\n\\n=== Reasoning and problem-solving ===\\nEarly researchers developed algorithms that imitated step-by-step reasoning that humans use when they solve puzzles or make logical deductions. By the late 1980s and 1990s, methods were developed for dealing with uncertain or incomplete information, employing concepts from probability and economics.\\nMany of these algorithms are insufficient for solving large reasoning problems because they experience a \"combinatorial explosion\": They become exponentially slower as the problems grow. Even humans rarely use the step-by-step deduction that early AI research could model. They solve most of their problems using fast, intuitive judgments. Accurate and efficient reasoning is an unsolved problem.\\n\\n\\n=== Knowledge representation ===\\n\\nKnowledge representation and knowledge engineering allow AI programs to answer questions intelligently and ma'),\n",

Generative AI continues to evolve rapidly as new models and applications emerge.\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\n\\n\\n=== Early history ===\\nThe origins of algorithmically generated media can be traced to the development of the Markov chain, which has been used to model natural language since the early 20th century. Russian mathematician Andrey Markov introduced the concept in 1906, including an analysis of vowel and consonant patterns in Eugeny Onegin. Once trained on a text corpus, a Markov chain can generate probabilistic text.\\nBy the early 1970s, artists began using computers to extend generative techniques beyond Markov models. Harold Cohen developed and exhibited works produced by AARON, a pioneering computer program designed to autonomously create paintings.\\nThe terms generative AI planning or generative planning were used in the 1980s and 1990s to refer to AI planning systems, especially computer-aided process planning, used to generate sequences of actions to reach a specified goal. Generative AI planning systems used symbolic AI methods such as state space search and constraint satisfaction and were a \"relatively mature\" technology by the early 1990s. They were used to generate crisis action plans for military use, process plans for manufacturing and decision plans such as in prototype autonomous spacecraft.\\n\\n\\n=== Generative neural networks (Late 2000s-) ===\\n\\nMachine learning uses both discriminative models and generative models to predict data. Beginning in the late 2000s, the introduction of deep learning technology led to improvements in image classification, speech recognition, natural language processing and other tasks. Neural networks in this era were typically trained as discriminative models due to the difficulty of generative modeling.\\nIn 2014, advancements such as the variational autoencoder and generative adversarial network produced the first practical deep neural networks capable of learning generative models, as opposed to discriminative ones, for complex data such as images. These deep generative models were the first to output not only class labels for images but also entire images, such as DeepDream.\\nIn 2017, the Transformer network enabled advancements in generative mo')]"

       "[Document(metadata={'source': 'speech.txt'}, page_content='The world must be made safe for democracy. Its peace must be planted upon the tested foundations of political liberty. We have no selfish ends to serve. We desire no conquest, no dominion. We seek no indemnities for ourselves, no material compensation for the sacrifices we shall freely make. We are but one of the champions of the rights of mankind. We shall be satisfied when those rights have been made as secure as the faith and the freedom of nations can make them.\\n\\nJust because we fight without rancor and without selfish object, seeking nothing for ourselves but what we shall wish to share with all free peoples, we shall, I feel confident, conduct our operations as belligerents without passion and ourselves observe with proud punctilio the principles of right and of fair play we profess to be fighting for.\\n\\n…\\n\\nIt will be all the easier for us to conduct ourselves as belligerents in a high spirit of right and fairness because we act without animus, not in enmity toward a people or with the desire to bring any injury or disadvantage upon them, but only in armed opposition to an irresponsible government which has thrown aside all considerations of humanity and of right and is running amuck. We are, let me say again, the sincere friends of the German people, and shall desire nothing so much as the early reestablishment of intimate relations of mutual advantage between us—however hard it may be for them, for the time being, to believe that this is spoken from our hearts.\\n\\nWe have borne with their present government through all these bitter months because of that friendship—exercising a patience and forbearance which would otherwise have been impossible. We shall, happily, still have an opportunity to prove that friendship in our daily attitude and actions toward the millions of men and women of German birth and native sympathy who live among us and share our life, and we shall be proud to prove it toward all who are in fact loyal to their neighbors and to the government in the hour of test. They are, most of them, as true and loyal Americans as if they had never known any other fealty or allegiance. They will be prompt to stand with us in rebuking and restraining the few who may be of a different mind and purpose. If there should be disloyalty, it will be dealt with with a firm hand of stern repression; but, if it lifts its head at all, it will lift it only here and there and without countenance except from a lawless and malignant few.\\n\\nIt is a distressing and oppressive duty, gentlemen of the Congress, which I have performed in thus addressing you. There are, it may be, many months of fiery trial and sacrifice ahead of us. It is a fearful thing to lead this great peaceful people into war, into the most terrible and disastrous of all wars, civilization itself seeming to be in the balance. But the right is more precious than peace, and we shall fight for the things which we have always carried nearest our hearts—for democracy, for the right of those who submit to authority to have a voice in their own governments, for the rights and liberties of small nations, for a universal dominion of right by such a concert of free peoples as shall bring peace and safety to all nations and make the world itself at last free.\\n\\nTo such a task we can dedicate our lives and our fortunes, everything that we are and everything that we have, with the pride of those who know that the day has come when America is privileged to spend her blood and her might for the principles that gave her birth and happiness and the peace which she has treasured. God helping her, she can do no other.')]"
